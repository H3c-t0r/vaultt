type is numericoid or keystring:
 keystring = leadkeychar *keychar
      leadkeychar = ALPHA
      keychar = ALPHA / DIGIT / HYPHEN
 numericoid = number 1*( DOT number )

example oid:
givenname = 2.5.4.42 

 If the AttributeType is of the dotted-decimal form, the
   AttributeValue is represented by an number sign ('#' U+0023)
   character followed by the hexadecimal encoding of each of the octets
   of the BER encoding of the X.500 AttributeValue.
