```release-note:security
Limited Unauthenticated Remove Peer: As of Vault 1.5.5+, the remove-peer command
on DR secondaries did not require authentication. This issue impacts the
stability of HA architecture, as a bad actor could remove all peers from a DR
secondary. This issue affects Vault Enterprise 1.5.5 and 1.5.6, and is fixed in
1.5.7 and 1.6.2 (CVE-2021-3282).
