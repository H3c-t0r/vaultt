These templates parent form components that render within an modal to create inline items while using SearchSelectWithModal.
The modal opens when a user searches for an item that doesn't exist and clicks 'No results found for "${term}". Click here to create it.'
The templates are render using the {{component}} helper in 'search-select-with-modal.hbs' and are responsible for creating the model passed to the form.
