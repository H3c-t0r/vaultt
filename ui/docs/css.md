## Guidelines

- **Helper classes** should be used (`app/styles/helper-classes`) if a styling block does not already exist and/or a reasonable number of helper classes can cover the desired style.
- **Core classes** (`app/styles/core/core-file-name.scss`) are styling for a class that are not associated with a component. The scope of each file is defined by the file name.
- **Component specific styling** (`app/styles/components/component-file-name.scss`) should only be added to, or created when you cannot achieve the styling with a helper class or core class.
- **Utils'** files (`app/utils/util-file-name.scss`) define mixins, and variables. 
- Default to using rem sizes for all font-sizing.

> ### Known issues
> The following are known issues that we are working to address in conjunction with the adoption of HDS.
> 1. **Size variables** The UI does not follow a consistent size variable pattern. We use both px and rem to define font-size and we use px, rem, and ems to define margins, heights, etc. For accessibility reasons we _should_ define all font-sizing at the very least by rem, though this is not consistently done in the app.
> 2. **Variable naming** The UI does not have a consistent pattern to variable naming. We use a mix of numbers and words (ex: `ui-gray-050` is the same as `ui-gray-lightest`, and both are used).
> 3. **Random variables** Likely because of the age of the app we have dieing but not dead variables. For example, we have some variables that define box-shadows and we have some variables to define animations, but we are missing many box-shadow definitions and we do not consistently use the animation variables.
> 4. **Missing variables** The UI does not have a variable for all commonly occurring sizes and colors. For example, we do not have a variable that covers the `14px` though it is a commonly used size.
> 5. **!Important** `!important` is sprinkled throughout helper, core and component files. Ideally, the cascading and order of styles would eliminate the need of this key-word. However because it exists randomly in many of our files, we now have cascading issues inside helper files and core files. In all known cases where these issues exists a comment has been left as to why the order of classes in that particular area matters.

### Helper classes

For context, a good portion of our class definitions have come from Bulmaâ€”a third-party framework. Bulma has since been removed, but we still rely on many of its class definitions. One thing about Bulma class definitions, specifically their helper classes, is that they always end in the keyword  `!important`. This use of `important!` and Bulma specific naming patterns has led to a mix of inconsistent helper class names. Moving forward, we have agreed as a team to pursue the following patterns. When it makes sense, please default to these instead of relying on existing helper names for guidance.

- Drop the starting verb. Many of our helper classes start with a verb `has` or `is`. Going forward we prefer to drop the verb. `margin-bottom` instead of `is-margin-bottom`.
- Start your helper class name with what the class controls. `margin-bottom` instead of `bottom-margin`.
- Match your helper class size to a pre-existing size variable. `margin-bottom-large` instead of `margin-bottom-big`.

### Core class styles

All files under `app/styles/core` directory define style for the class of the file name. Think of these as files for the heavily used classes that are not defined as a component. Things like `.box` or `.title`. These classes are used in our app over many files that span over multiple components, but they are themselves are _not_ components.

If the core file ends in a `s` (e.g. `lists` or `containers`) the plural indicates that the file defines more than just the style for the class `container`. The `core/containers.scss` file defines classes for all things relating to container-type classes: `page-container`, `section` as well as the `container` class. There are only a few plural core files as they are the exception and not the norm.

### Component specific styling



## Gut check
Let's run through a couple of style situations and using the guidelines above we will determine the best style solution.

1. Designs include something like the following. There is a new color red, not defined as variable and a font-size in 14px.

2. You want to make a button that has a hover over effect with box-shadow

3. You want to make a new component that looks similar to the selectable-card component but does xx differently.

4. Helper class or styling block? (Jordan's example)

5. Helper class or styling block? (6 helper classes needed)

6. Should I create a core class? Probably not.

## When in doubt

If you ever feel unsure about a styling or SCSS decision please leave a comment on the code and the team can give you feedback.
