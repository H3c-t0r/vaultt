# `/sys/config/group-policy-application`

The `sys/config/group-policy-application` endpoint can be used to configure the
mode of policy application for identity groups in Vault. Policy application in this case
refers to whether or not a policy as defined in a group will apply to a member of that group.
Currently, it only supports two modes, `within_namespace_hierarchy` (default), which
means that policies will only be applied and asserted on from groups in parent namespaces, and
`any` which means that every policy will be applied, irrespective of namespace hierarchy.

Note that this configuration will be replicated between primary and secondaries, that
is to say, primaries cannot have a different policy application mode to secondaries.

## Get Group Policy Application Information

~> **Enterprise Only** – This endpoint requires Vault Enterprise.

This endpoint returns the current group policy application mode, which will be
either `within_namespace_hierarchy` or `any`.


| Method | Path                          |
| :----- | :---------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/sys/config/group-policy-application` |

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
  --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    'http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/config/group-policy-application'
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
   "group_policy_application_mode": "within_namespace_hierarchy"
}
```

## Set Group Policy Application Information

~> **Enterprise Only** – This endpoint requires Vault Enterprise.

This endpoint allows you to modify the current group policy application mode, which can be
either `within_namespace_hierarchy` or `any`. `within_namespace_hierarchy`
restricts policy application to only policies from groups from parent namespaces, and
`any` does not restrict policy application in any way, and policies will apply from any namespace,
irrespective of namespace hierarchy.
