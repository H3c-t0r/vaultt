# Remount ( API )

The Remount documentation details the endpoints required to trigger and monitor the status of a remount operation.

## Move Backend

The `/sys/remount` endpoint moves an already-mounted backend to a new mount point. This works for both secret engines
and auth methods.

It can be used to move the backend across namespaces as well, with the namespaces supplied as prefixes
on the path arguments. For this case, the namespaces of both the source and destination mounts need to be 
either the namespace in which the /remount endpoint is called, or children of it. Say, we have 3 namespaces 
ns1/, ns1/ns2/ and ns1/ns3. We want to move the mount `secret` from ns1/ns2/secret to ns1/ns3/secret. 
We can either invoke from the root namespace with the `from` argument as ns1/ns2/secret and `to` argument 
as ns1/ns3/new-secret, or we can invoke it from the namespace ns1/, with `from` as ns2/secret and `to` 
as ns3/new-secret.

The remount operation can be a long running operation, hence the invocation of /remount triggers the start of 
the remount process, returning a migration ID to the user. The user then uses the migration ID to lookup 
the status of the mount migration.

~> Note: This endpoint requires a policy with both `sudo` and `update` capabilities to `sys/remount`

~> Note: A mount migration will revoke all leases for the secrets of a secrets backend or tokens of an auth backend,
depending on which type of backend is being moved.


| Method | Path           |
| :----- | :------------- |
| `POST` | `/sys/remount` |

### Parameters

- `from` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the previous mount point.

- `to` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the new destination mount point.

### Sample Payload ( Cross Namespace)

```json
{
  "from": "ns1/ns2/secret",
  "to": "ns1/ns3/new-secret"
}
```

### Sample Payload ( Within Namespace)

```json
{
  "from": "secret",
  "to": "new-secret"
}
```

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    --request POST \
    --data @payload.json \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/remount
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "migration_id": "ef3ba21c-8be8-4e5f-8d00-cb46a532c665"
}
```

## Monitor Migration Status

This endpoint is used to monitor the status of a mount migration operation, using the ID returned in the response
of the `sys/remount` call. The response contains the passed in ID, the source and target mounts, and a status field
which can be one of `in-progress`, `success` or `failure`.

| Method | Path           |
| :----- | :------------- |
| `GET` | `/sys/remount/status/:migration_id` |

### Parameters

- `migration_id` `(string: <required>)` – Specifies the id of the mount migration

### Sample Request

```shell-session
$ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/remount/status/ef3ba21c-8be8-4e5f-8d00-cb46a532c665
```

### Sample Response

```json
{
  "migration_id": "ef3ba21c-8be8-4e5f-8d00-cb46a532c665",
  "migration_info": {
    "source_mount": "ns1/ns2/secret",
    "target_mount": "ns1/ns3/new-secret",
    "status": "in-progress",
  }
}
```
