  Vault Agent's Template Config to set Templating Engine behavior

# Vault Agent Template Config

Template Config allows users of Vault Agent to determine the behavior that
pertains to the templating engine.

## Functionality

The `template_config` stanza configures overall default behavior for the
templating engine. Note that `template_config` can only be defined once, and is
different from the `template` stanza. Unlike `template` which focuses on where
and how a specific secret is rendered, `template_config` contains parameters
affects how the templating engine as a whole behaves and its interaction with
the rest of Agent. This includes, but is not limited to, program exit behavior.
Other parameters that applies to the templating engine as a whole may be added
over time.

### Interaction with `error_on_missing_key`

The parameter [`error_on_missing_key`](/docs/agent/template#error_on_missing_key) can be specified within the `template`
stanza which determines if a template should error when a key is missing
in the secret. When `error_on_missing_key` is
not specified or set to `false` and the key to render is not in the secret's
response, the templating engine will ignore it (or render `"<no value>"`)
and continue on with its rendering.

If the desire is to have Agent fail and exit on a missing key, both
`template.error_on_missing_key` and `template_config.exit_on_retry_failure` must
be set to true. Otherwise, the templating engine will error and render to its
destination, but agent will not exit and retry until it's able to do so or until
the process is terminated.

Note that a missing key from a secret's response is different from a missing or
non-existent secret. The templating engine will always error if a secret is
missing, but will only error for a missing key if `error_on_missing_key` is set.
Whether Vault Agent will exit when the templating engine errors depends on the
value of `exit_on_retry_failure`.

## Configuration

The top level `template_config` block has the following configuration entries:

- `exit_on_retry_failure` `(bool: false)` - This option configures Vault Agent
to exit after it has exhausted its number of template retry attempts due to
failures.
