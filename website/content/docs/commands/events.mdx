# events

Use the `events` command to get a real-time display of
[events](/vault/docs/concepts/events) generated by Vault and subscribe to Vault
events. Note that the `events subscribe` runs indefinitly and will not exit on
its own unless it encounters an unexpected error. Similar to `tail -f` in the
Unix world, you must terminate the process from the command line to end the
`events` command.

Specify the desired event types (also called "topics") as a glob pattern. To match
against multiple events, use `*` as a wildcard. The command returns serialized
JSON objects in the default protobuf JSON serialization format with one line per
event received.

Note that this command is designed to run indefinitely. It is similar to
`tail -f` in the Unix world. This command will not exit on its own unless it
encounters an unexpected error. As a user, you must terminate this process
yourself to shut it down.

## Examples

Subscribe to all events:

```shell-session
$ vault events subscribe '*'
```

Subscribe to all KV events:

```shell-session
$ vault events subscribe 'kv*'
```

Subscribe to all `kv-v2/data-write` events:

```shell-session
$ vault events subscribe kv-v2/data-write
```

Subscribe to all non-`data-write` KV events for the secret `secret/data/foo` in
the current namespace as well as namespace `ns1`:

```shell-session
$ vault events subscribe -namespaces=ns1 -filter='data_path == secret/data/foo and operation != "data-write"' 'kv*'
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Options

- `-timeout`: `(duration: "")` - close the WebSocket automatically after the
  specified duration.

- `-filter` `(string: "")` - Filter expression used to select events to be sent
  through the WebSocket.

  See [Boundary's docs](/boundary/docs/concepts/filtering) on how these
  expressions are evaluated and what options are available.

  The following values are available in the filter expression:
  - `event_type`: the event type, e.g., `kv-v2/data-write`.
	- `operation`: the operation name that caused the event, e.g., `write`.
	- `source_plugin_mount`: the mount of the plugin that produced the event,
    e.g., `secret/`
	- `data_path`: the API path that can be used to access the data of the secret related to the event, e.g., `secret/data/foo`
	- `namespace`: the path of the namespace that created the event, e.g., `ns1/`

  By default, the filter will be empty and will match all events that the
  request has access to for the given event types specified in the request.

  A filter could be as simple as `data_path == secret/data/foo` to specify that
  only events that refer to the `data_path` of `secret/data/foo` should be sent
  via the WebSocket.

  A filter can also be more complex, for example:
  ```
  data_path == secret/data/foo and operation != write
  ```

  The filter is applied after policy checks.

### Enterprise Options

<EnterpriseAlert product="vault" />

- `-namespaces` `(string)` - Additional child namespaces to subscribe to. Can
  be repeated to add more namespace patterns. The namespace of the request is
  automatically prepended, so specifying `ns2` when the request is in the `ns1`
  namespace will result in subscribing to `ns1/ns2` (in addition to `ns1`).
  Patterns can include `*` characters to indicate wildcards. The default is to
  subscribe only to the request's namespace.

  -> Note: A root token, or a token associated with entities and groups with
     the appropriate policies, must be used for the event subscription
     request to be able to subscribe to multiple namespaces. See
     [this tutorial](/vault/tutorials/enterprise/namespaces) for an example
     setup.
