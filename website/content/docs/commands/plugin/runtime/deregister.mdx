  runtime catalog.

# plugin runtime deregister

Deregister an existing plugin runtime in the catalog with the given name. If
any registered plugin references the plugin runtime, an error is returned. If
the plugin runtime does not exist, an error is returned. The `-type` flag
currently only accepts "container".

## Examples

Deregister a plugin:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin runtime deregister -type=container my-plugin-runtime
Success! Deregistered plugin runtime: my-plugin-runtime
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

- `-type` `(string: "")` - Plugin runtime type. Vault currently only supports
  "container" runtime type.
