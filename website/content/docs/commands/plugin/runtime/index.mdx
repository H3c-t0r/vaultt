# plugin runtime

The "plugin runtime" command groups subcommands for interacting with
Vault's plugin runtimes, configuring the context within which external
plugins can be run.

To use a registered plugin runtime, use the `-runtime` option with the
[plugin registration command](/docs/commands/plugin/register).

Currently, the only supported type of plugin runtime is "container".

## Examples

Register a new plugin runtime to the catalog:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin runtime register -type=container -oci_runtime=runc runc
Success! Registered plugin runtime: runc
```

List all available plugin runtimes in the catalog:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin runtime list

Name    Type         OCI Runtime    Parent Cgroup    CPU Nanos    Memory Bytes
----    ----         -----------    -------------    ---------    ------------
runc    container    runc           n/a              0            0
```

Get information about a plugin runtime in the catalog:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin runtime info -type=container runc
Key              Value
---              -----
cgroup_parent    n/a
cpu_nanos        0
memory_bytes     0
name             runc
oci_runtime      runc
type             container
```
