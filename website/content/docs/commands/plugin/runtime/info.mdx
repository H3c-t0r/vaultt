# plugin runtime info

Displays information about a plugin runtime in the catalog with the given name. If
the plugin runtime does not exist, an error is returned. The `-type` flag currently
only accepts "container".

## Examples

Display information about a plugin

```shell-session
$ vault plugin runtime info -type=container runc
Key              Value
---              -----
cgroup_parent    n/a
cpu_nanos        0
memory_bytes     0
name             runc
oci_runtime      runc
type             container
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Output options

- `-field` `(string: "")` - Print only the field with the given name. Specifying
  this option will take precedence over other formatting directives. The result
  will not have a trailing newline making it ideal for piping to other
  processes.

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.

### Command options

- `-type` `(string: "")` - Plugin runtime type. Vault currently only supports
  "container" runtime type.
