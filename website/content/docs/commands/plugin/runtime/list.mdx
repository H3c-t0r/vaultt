# plugin list

Lists available plugin runtimes registered in the catalog. This does not list whether
plugin runtimes are in use, but rather just their availability.

## Examples

List all available plugin runtimes in the catalog.

```shell-session
$ vault plugin runtime list

Name    Type         OCI Runtime    Parent Cgroup    CPU Nanos    Memory Bytes
----    ----         -----------    -------------    ---------    ------------
runc    container    runc           n/a              0            0
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Output options

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.

### Command options

- `-type` `(string: "")` - Plugin runtime type. Vault currently only supports
  "container" runtime type.
