# Filtering audit entries

This page describes how to use filters with Vault audit devices to fine tune which
audit entries should be written to an audit log.

Starting in Vault 1.16.0, audit devices can be enabled with a `filter` option which
is used to evaluate audit entries and decide if they should be written to an audit log.
Please ensure you are familiar with the [filtering concept](/vault/docs/concepts/filtering)
before attempting to configure an audit device with a filter.

## Fallback device

The ability to filter audit entries provides great flexibility to our customer's workflows,
however the additional complexity could mean that a Vault Operator could configure
their audit devices in such a way that some audit entries are missed out from the audit log entirely.

The `fallback` audit is the mechanism by which Vault can continue to adhere to
Vault's [security model](/vault/docs/internals/security), that all requests and
responses are successfully logged before the client receives any secret material.

When filtered audit devices are enabled, alongside the fallback audit device, any
audit entry that would have been ignored/missed due to filter settings will be sent
to the fallback device to be written to its audit log.

This means we are able to provide the same guarantee that 'at least one device must
successfully write an audit entry' as when only standard/non-filtered audit devices
are enabled.

<Note title="Single fallback device">
  Vault supports enabling only a single fallback audit device.
