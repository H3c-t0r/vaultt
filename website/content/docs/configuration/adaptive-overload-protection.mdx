  prevent workloads from overloading different resources of the Vault servers.

# `adaptive_overload_protection`

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

@include 'alerts/beta.mdx'

The `adaptive_overload_protection` stanza allows operators to control overload
protection features. Changes to this stanza require a server restart to take
effect.

For more information read [Adaptive Overload
Protection](/vault/docs/concepts/adaptive-overload-protection).


```hcl
adaptive_overload_protection {
  disable_write_controller = false
}
```

## `adaptive_overload_protection` parameters

These parameters apply to the `adaptive_overload_protection` stanza in the Vault
configuration file:

- `disable_write_controller` `(bool: <optional>)`: Disables the adaptive write
  overload controller. Defaults to `true` (controller disabled). Set this to
  `false` explicitly to enable the write controller during the beta period.



~> **Warning** This feature is still in Beta. We recommend testing this in
pre-production with realistic workloads and traffic levels.
