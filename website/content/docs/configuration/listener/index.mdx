# `listener` stanza

The `listener` stanza configures the addresses and ports on which Vault will
respond to requests. At this time, there are two listeners:
- [TCP][tcp]
- [Unix Domain Socket][unix]

[tcp]: /vault/docs/configuration/listener/tcp
[unix]: /vault/docs/configuration/listener/unix

## Unauthenticated endpoints - sensitive data redaction

There are four different types of information deemed sensitive that can be returned
by unauthenticated API endpoints:

1. Version number
2. Build date
3. Cluster name
4. IP address

Vault offers the ability to configure each `listener` stanza such that when appropriate,
these values will be redacted from responses.

The following API endpoints support redaction based on `listener` stanza configuration:

* [`/sys/health`](api-docs/system/health)
* [`/sys/leader`](api-docs/system/leader)
* [`/sys/seal-status`](api-docs/system/seal-status)

When a value is redacted by Vault, it will be replaced with an empty string (`""`).

~> Note: In certain situations, due to an empty string value, the related key may
no longer be present in the response object returned from the API, as that field is
omitted when the value is empty (`""`).

~> Note: The Vault API is also consumed by the Vault CLI and UI, therefore enabling redaction
settings will also affect them both.

## Redaction examples

Please see [redaction settings](docs/configuration/listener#redaction-settings)
(below) for details on each redaction setting.

Example configuration for the [`tcp`](docs/configuration/listener/tcp) listener,
enabling [`redact_addresses`](docs/configuration/listener#redact_addresses),
[`redact_cluster_name`](docs/configuration/listener#redact_cluster_name) and
[`redact_version`](docs/configuration/listener#redact_version).

```hcl
ui            = true
cluster_addr  = "https://127.0.0.1:8201"
api_addr      = "https://127.0.0.1:8200"
disable_mlock = true

storage "raft" {
  path = "/path/to/raft/data"
  node_id = "raft_node_1"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address             = "127.0.0.1:8200",
  tls_cert_file = "/path/to/full-chain.pem"
  tls_key_file  = "/path/to/private-key.pem"
  redact_addresses    = "true"
  redact_cluster_name = "true"
  redact_version      = "true"
}

telemetry {
  statsite_address = "127.0.0.1:8125"
  disable_hostname = true
}
```

### API: `/sys/health`

`curl -s https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/health | jq`:

```json
{
  "initialized": true,
  "sealed": false,
  "standby": true,
  "performance_standby": false,
  "replication_performance_mode": "disabled",
  "replication_dr_mode": "disabled",
  "server_time_utc": 1696598650,
  "version": "",
  "cluster_id": "a1a7a078-0ae1-7fb9-41ec-2f4f583c773e"
}
```

When comparing the JSON response above to when redaction settings are not enabled,
we can see that `cluster_name` is not present (it is now omitted due to being empty).
Also, that `version` is now redacted and shown only as `""`.

### API: `sys/leader`

`curl -s https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/leader | jq`:

```json
{
  "ha_enabled": true,
  "is_self": false,
  "active_time": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "leader_address": "",
  "leader_cluster_address": "",
  "performance_standby": false,
  "performance_standby_last_remote_wal": 0,
  "raft_committed_index": 164,
  "raft_applied_index": 164
}
```

When comparing the JSON response above to when redaction settings are not enabled,
we can see that `leader_address` and `leader_cluster_address` are now redacted and
shown only as `""`.

### API: `sys/seal-status`

`curl -s https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/seal-status | jq`:

```json
{
  "type": "shamir",
  "initialized": true,
  "sealed": false,
  "t": 1,
  "n": 1,
  "progress": 0,
  "nonce": "",
  "version": "",
  "build_date": "",
  "migration": false,
  "cluster_id": "a1a7a078-0ae1-7fb9-41ec-2f4f583c773e",
  "recovery_seal": false,
  "storage_type": "raft"
}
```

When comparing the JSON response above to when redaction settings are not enabled,
we can see that `cluster_name` is not present (it is now omitted due to being empty).
Also, that `build_date` and `version` are now redacted and shown only as `""`.

### CLI: `vault status`

```
Key                     Value
---                     -----
Seal Type               shamir
Initialized             true
Sealed                  false
Total Shares            5
Threshold               3
Version                 n/a
Build Date              n/a
Storage Type            raft
HA Enabled              true
HA Cluster              n/a
HA Mode                 standby
Active Node Address     <none>
Raft Committed Index    219
Raft Applied Index      219
```

When examining the output of `vault status` we can see that `Version`, `Build Date`
and `HA Cluster` show as `n/a`. Also, that `Active Node Address` shows as `<none>`.


## Common configuration options

The following options apply to both types of listener (see above), and can be configured
for each individual listener stanza.

Please see the [sensitive data redaction](docs/configuration/listener#unauthenticated-endpoints-sensitive-data-redaction) explanation above for further information.

### Redaction settings

- `redact_addresses` `(bool: false)` - If enabled, will redact `leader_address` and `cluster_leader_address` values when applicable.
- `redact_cluster_name` `(bool: false)` - If enabled, will redact `cluster_name` values when applicable.
- `redact_version` `(bool: false)` - If enabled, will redact `version` and `build_date` values when applicable.
