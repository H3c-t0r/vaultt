# `listener` stanza

The `listener` stanza configures the addresses and ports on which Vault will
respond to requests. At this time, there are two types of listeners:
- [TCP][tcp]
- [Unix Domain Socket][unix]

[tcp]: /vault/docs/configuration/listener/tcp
[unix]: /vault/docs/configuration/listener/unix

## Sensitive data redaction for unauthenticated endpoints

Unauthenticated API endpoints may return the following sensitive information:

* Vault version number
* Vault binary build date
* Vault cluster name
* IP address of nodes in the cluster

Vault offers the ability to configure each `listener` stanza such that when appropriate,
these values will be redacted from responses.

The following API endpoints support redaction based on `listener` stanza configuration:

* [`/sys/health`](/vault/api-docs/system/health)
* [`/sys/leader`](/vault/api-docs/system/leader)
* [`/sys/seal-status`](/vault/api-docs/system/seal-status)

Vault replaces redacted information with an empty string (`""`). Some Vault APIs
also omit keys from the response when the corresponding value is empty (`""`).

<Note title="Redacting values affects responses to all API clients">
  The Vault CLI and UI consume Vault API responses. As a result, your redaction
  settings will apply to CLI and UI output in addition to direct API calls.
</Note>

## Common configuration options

The following options apply to both types of listener (`tcp`/`unix`), and can be configured
for each individual listener stanza.

### Redaction settings

- `redact_addresses` `(bool: false)` - Redacts `leader_address` and `cluster_leader_address` values in applicable API responses when `true`.
- `redact_cluster_name` `(bool: false)` - Redacts `cluster_name` values in applicable API responses when `true`.
- `redact_version` `(bool: false)` - Redacts `version` and `build_date` values in applicable API responses when `true`.

## Redaction examples

Please see [redaction settings](/vault/docs/configuration/listener#redaction-settings)
(above) for details on each redaction setting.

Example configuration for the [`tcp`](/vault/docs/configuration/listener/tcp) listener,
enabling [`redact_addresses`](/vault/docs/configuration/listener#redact_addresses),
[`redact_cluster_name`](/vault/docs/configuration/listener#redact_cluster_name) and
[`redact_version`](/vault/docs/configuration/listener#redact_version).

```hcl
ui            = true
cluster_addr  = "https://127.0.0.1:8201"
api_addr      = "https://127.0.0.1:8200"
disable_mlock = true

storage "raft" {
  path = "/path/to/raft/data"
  node_id = "raft_node_1"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address             = "127.0.0.1:8200",
  tls_cert_file = "/path/to/full-chain.pem"
  tls_key_file  = "/path/to/private-key.pem"
  redact_addresses    = "true"
  redact_cluster_name = "true"
  redact_version      = "true"
}

telemetry {
  statsite_address = "127.0.0.1:8125"
  disable_hostname = true
}
```

### API: `/sys/health`

`curl -s https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/health | jq`:

```json
{
  "initialized": true,
  "sealed": false,
  "standby": true,
  "performance_standby": false,
  "replication_performance_mode": "disabled",
  "replication_dr_mode": "disabled",
  "server_time_utc": 1696598650,
  "version": "",
  "cluster_id": "a1a7a078-0ae1-7fb9-41ec-2f4f583c773e"
}
```

When comparing the JSON response above to when redaction settings are not enabled,
we can see that `cluster_name` is not present (it is now omitted due to being empty).
Also, that `version` is now redacted and shown only as `""`.

### API: `sys/leader`

`curl -s https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/leader | jq`:

```json
{
  "ha_enabled": true,
  "is_self": false,
  "active_time": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "leader_address": "",
  "leader_cluster_address": "",
  "performance_standby": false,
  "performance_standby_last_remote_wal": 0,
  "raft_committed_index": 164,
  "raft_applied_index": 164
}
```

When comparing the JSON response above to when redaction settings are not enabled,
we can see that `leader_address` and `leader_cluster_address` are now redacted and
shown only as `""`.

### API: `sys/seal-status`

`curl -s https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/seal-status | jq`:

```json
{
  "type": "shamir",
  "initialized": true,
  "sealed": false,
  "t": 1,
  "n": 1,
  "progress": 0,
  "nonce": "",
  "version": "",
  "build_date": "",
  "migration": false,
  "cluster_id": "a1a7a078-0ae1-7fb9-41ec-2f4f583c773e",
  "recovery_seal": false,
  "storage_type": "raft"
}
```

When comparing the JSON response above to when redaction settings are not enabled,
we can see that `cluster_name` is not present (it is now omitted due to being empty).
Also, that `build_date` and `version` are now redacted and shown only as `""`.

### CLI: `vault status`

```
Key                     Value
---                     -----
Seal Type               shamir
Initialized             true
Sealed                  false
Total Shares            5
Threshold               3
Version                 n/a
Build Date              n/a
Storage Type            raft
HA Enabled              true
HA Cluster              n/a
HA Mode                 standby
Active Node Address     <none>
Raft Committed Index    219
Raft Applied Index      219
```

When examining the output of `vault status` we can see that `Version`, `Build Date`
and `HA Cluster` show as `n/a`. Also, that `Active Node Address` shows as `<none>`.
