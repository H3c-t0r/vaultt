# Best practices for programmatic Vault management

The best way to manage Vault at scale is to [codify management](/vault/tutorials/operations/codify-mgmt-vault-terraform)
with [Terraform](/terraform) and the [Terraform Vault provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest).

## Terraform recommendations

- **Avoid reading or writing long-lived static secrets to Vault from Terraform**.
  Data read to, or written from, Terraform persists in the Terraform state file
  and any generated plan files.
- **Encrypt the Terraform state file**. Protect the state file with a secure,
  encrypted backend.
- **Follow the principle of least privilege**. Limit who has read/write access
  to your Terraform state file.
- **Keep Vault resources under Terraform management**. Use Terraform to apply
  policy and governance at scale using infrastructure as code (IaC). We
  recommend using Terraform to manage administration resources such as
  authentication methods, plugins, namespaces, and policies.
  
For example, your security team might have specific ACL or Sentinel policies
that apply to every Vault namespace. If you add a new Vault namespace to the
Terraform configuration, you can rely on Terraform to apply the correct
governance policies for that namespace. However, suppose a Vault namespace
administrator creates a child namespace directly from the Vault CLI or API. In
that case, this new namespace will not be under Terraform management and likely
will not have the required governance policies that would have been applied with
the Terraform workflow.

One way to prevent this is to restrict certain capabilities that would otherwise
allow Vault operators to create or modify resources that Terraform should manage.
For example, you can 
[block namespace manipulation with Sentinel policies](https://go.hashi.co/support-block-ns-manipulation-with-sentinel).

## Authenticating to Vault

- **Use dynamic secrets with short-lived credentials When interacting with Vault using Terraform whenever possible.
Short-lived credentials that persist in a state file greatly reduce the risk of an attack, as the credentials will likely have expired in the event of a compromised state file.
