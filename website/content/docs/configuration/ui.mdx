# Vault UI

Vault features a user interface (web interface) for interacting with Vault.
Easily create, read, update, and delete secrets, authenticate, unseal, and
more with the Vault UI.

-> The UI requires **Vault 0.10 or higher** or Vault Enterprise.

~> **Vault 1.13** deprecated the `ui` parameter. The UI can now be enabled using
the `ui_config.enabled` configuration option.

## Activating the Vault UI

The Vault UI is not activated by default. To activate the UI, set the `ui_config.enabled`
configuration option in the Vault server configuration. Vault clients do not
need to set this option, since they will not be serving the UI.

```hcl
ui_config {
  enabled = true
}

listener "tcp" {
  # ...
}
```

## `ui_config` Parameters

The `ui_config` stanza supports the following parameters:

  - `enabled` `bool: false` - Whether to enable the Vault UI. This must be a
    boolean value and defaults to `false`. In `-dev` mode this defaults to `true`.
    This parameter replaces the `ui` parameter since Vault 1.13.0.
  - `dir` `string: ""` - This specifies that the web UI should be served from an
    external directory rather than the build in one. This allows for customization
    or development.


## Accessing the Vault UI

The UI runs on the same port as the Vault listener. As such, you must configure
at least one `listener` stanza in order to access the UI.

```hcl
listener "tcp" {
  address = "10.0.1.35:8200"

  # If bound to localhost, the Vault UI is only
  # accessible from the local machine!
  # address = "127.0.0.1:8200"
}
```

In this case, the UI is accessible at the following URL from any machine on the
subnet (provided no network firewalls are in place):

```text
https://10.0.1.35:8200/ui/
```

It is also accessible at any DNS entry that resolves to that IP address, such as
the Consul service address (if using Consul):

```text
https://vault.service.consul:8200/ui/
```

### Note on TLS

When using TLS (recommended), the certificate must be valid for all DNS entries
you will be accessing the Vault UI on, and any IP addresses on the SAN. If you
are running Vault with a self-signed certificate, any browsers that access the
Vault UI will need to have the root CA installed. Failure to do so may result in
the browser displaying a warning that the site is "untrusted". It is highly
recommended that client browsers accessing the Vault UI install the proper CA
root for validation to reduce the chance of a MITM attack.
