# Vault Enterprise Licenses

## Overview

A Vault Enterprise license needs to be applied to a Vault cluster
in order to use Vault Enterprise features.

The license can be applied to a cluster from any server in it with this command.
```
vault write sys/license text="01MV4UU43BK5HGYYTOJZWFQM..."
```

You could also use the Vault HTTP API against the [`sys/license`](/api-docs/system/license.mdx)
endpoint.
