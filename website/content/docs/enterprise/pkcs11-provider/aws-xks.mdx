# Vault with AWS KMS External Key Store (XKS) via PKCS#11 and XKS Proxy

~> **Note**: AWS [`xks-proxy`](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-kms-xks-proxy) is used in this document as a sample implementation.

Vault's KMIP Secrets Engine can be used as an external key store for the AWS KMS [External Key Store (XKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-kms-external-key-store-xks/) protocol using the AWS [`xks-proxy`](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-kms-xks-proxy) along
with the [Vault PKCS#11 Provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/pkcs11-provider).

## Overview

This is tested as working with Vault 1.11.0 Enterprise (and later) with Advanced Data Protection (KMIP support).

Prerequisites:

* A server capable of running XKS Proxy, which is exposed to the Internet or a VPC endpoint. This can be the same as the Vault server.
* `libvault-pkcs11.so` downloaded from [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault-pkcs11-provider) for your platform and available on the XKS Proxy server.
* Vault Enterprise with the KMIP Secrets Engine available and with TCP port 5696 accessible to where XKS Proxy will be running.

There are 3 parts to this setup:

1. Vault KMIP Secrets Engine standard setup. (There is nothing specific to XKS in this setup.)
1. Vault PKCS#11 setup to tell the PKCS#11 provider (`libvault-pkcs11.so`) how to talk to the Vault KMIP Secrets Engine. (There is nothing specific to XKS in this setup.)
1. XKS Proxy setup.

## Vault Setup

On the Vault server, we need to [setup the KMIP Secrets Engine](/docs/secrets/kmip):

1. Start the [KMIP Secrets Engine](/docs/secrets/kmip) and listener:

    ```sh
    vault secrets enable kmip
    vault write kmip/config listen_addrs=0.0.0.0:5696
    ```

1. Create a KMIP scope to contain the AES keys that will be accessible.
   The KMIP scope is essentially an isolated namespace.
   Here is an example creating one called `my-service` (which will be used throughout this document).

    ```sh
    vault write -f kmip/scope/my-service
    ```

1. Create a KMIP role that has access to the scope:

    ```sh
    vault write kmip/scope/my-service/role/admin operation_all=true
    ```

1. Create TLS credentials (a certificate, key, and CA bundle) for the KMIP role:

    ~> **Note**: This command will output the credentials in plaintext.

    ```sh
    vault write -f -format=json kmip/scope/my-service/role/admin/credential/generate | tee kmip.json
    ```

    The response from the `credential/generate` endpoint is JSON.
    The `.data.certificate` entry contains a bundle of the TLS client key and certificate we will use to connect to KMIP with from `xks-proxy`.
    The `.data.ca_chain[]` entries contain the CA bundle to verify the KMIP server's certificate.
    Save these to, e.g., `cert.pem` and `ca.pem`:

    ```sh
    jq --raw-output --exit-status '.data.ca_chain[]' kmip.json > ca.pem
    jq --raw-output --exit-status '.data.certificate' kmip.json > cert.pem
    ```

1. Create an AES-256 key in KMIP, for example, using `pkcs11-tool` (usually installed with the OpenSC package). See the [Vault docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/pkcs11-provider) for the full setup.
   ```sh
   VAULT_LOG_FILE=/dev/null pkcs11-tool --module ./libvault-pkcs11.so --keygen -a abc123 --key-type AES:32 \
       --extractable --allow-sw
   Key generated:
   Secret Key Object; AES length 32
   VALUE:
   label:      abc123
   Usage:      encrypt, decrypt, wrap, unwrap
   Access:     none
   ```


## XKS Proxy Setup

The rest of the steps take place on the XKS Proxy server.

1. Copy the `libvault-pkcs11.so` binary somewhere on the server, such as `/usr/local/lib` (should be same as in the TOML config file below), and `chmod` it so that it is executable.

1. Copy the TLS certificate bundle (e.g., `/etc/kmip/cert.pem`) and CA bundle (e.g., `/etc/kmip/ca.pem`) to the `xks-proxy` server (doesn't matter where, as long as the `xks-proxy` process has access to it) from the Vault setup.

1. Create a `configuration/settings_vault.toml` file for the XKS to Vault PKCS#11 configuration,
   and set the `XKS_PROXY_SETTINGS_TOML` environment variable to point to the file location.

   The important settings to change:

   * `[tls]`: change key and certificate location to point to KMIP certs
   * `[[external_key_stores]]`:
     * change URI path prefix to anything you like
     * choose random access ID
     * choose random secret key
     * set which key labels are accessible to XKS (`xks_key_id_set`)
   * `[pkcs11]`: set the `PKCS11_HSM_MODULE` to the location of the `libvault-pkcs11.so` (or `.dylib`) file downloaded from [releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault-pkcs11-provider).

   ```toml
   [server]
   ip = "0.0.0.0"
   port = 8000
   region = "us-east-1"
   service = "kms-xks-proxy"

   [server.tcp_keepalive]
   tcp_keepalive_secs = 60
   tcp_keepalive_retries = 3
   tcp_keepalive_interval_secs = 1

   [tracing]
   is_stdout_writer_enabled = true
   is_file_writer_enabled = true
   level = "DEBUG"
   directory = "/var/local/xks-proxy/logs"
   file_prefix = "xks-proxy.log"
   rotation_kind = "HOURLY"

   [security]
   is_sigv4_auth_enabled = true
   is_tls_enabled = true
   is_mtls_enabled = false

   [tls]
   tls_cert_pem = "tls/server_cert.pem"
   tls_key_pem = "tls/server_key.pem"
   mtls_client_ca_pem = "tls/client_ca.pem"
   mtls_client_dns_name = "us-east-1.alpha.cks.kms.aws.internal.amazonaws.com"

   [[external_key_stores]]
   uri_path_prefix = "/xyz"
   sigv4_access_id = "AKIA4GBY3I6JCE5M2HPM"
   sigv4_secret_key = "1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123="
   xks_key_id_set = ["abc123"]

   [pkcs11]
   session_pool_max_size = 30
   session_pool_timeout_milli = 0
   session_eager_close = false
   user_pin = ""
   PKCS11_HSM_MODULE = "/usr/local/lib/libvault-pkcs11.so"
   context_read_timeout_milli = 100

   [limits]
   max_plaintext_in_base64 = 8192
   max_aad_in_base64 = 16384

   [hsm_capabilities]
   can_generate_iv = false
   is_zero_iv_required = false
   ```

1. Create a file, `/etc/vault-pkcs11.hcl` with the following contents:

    ```hcl
    slot {
      server = "VAULT_ADDRESS:5696"
      tls_cert_path = "/etc/kmip/cert.pem"
      ca_path = "/etc/kmip/ca.pem"
      scope = "my-service"
    }
    ```

    This file is used by `libvault-pkcs11.so` to know how to find and communicate with the KMIP server.
    See [the Vault docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/pkcs11-provider) for all available parameters and their usage.

1. If you want to view the Vault logs (helpful when trying to find error messages), you can specify the `VAULT_LOG_FILE` (default is stdout) and `VAULT_LOG_LEVEL` (default is `INFO`). We'd recommend setting `VAULT_LOG_FILE` to something like `/tmp/vault.log` or `/var/log/vault.log`. Other useful log levels are `WARN` (quieter) and `TRACE` (very verbose, could possibly contain sensitive information, like raw network packets).

## Enable XKS in the AWS UI

1. Go into KMS settings in the AWS UI.
1. Go to "External key stores" in the navigation menu.
1. Click on "Create external key store"
1. Add the relevant settings:
   a. Key store name: the name you want your key store to be referred to in AWS
   a. Proxy URI endpoint: the base URI of the XKS proxy server (e.g., `https://xks.example.com:1234`)
   a. Proxy URI path prefix: added to the end of the base URI of the XKS proxy server when making requests
   a. Proxy credential, Access key ID: the access key you configured in the XKS proxy configuration file
   a. Proxy credential, Secret access key: the secret key you configured in the XKS proxy configuration file
1. Create the external key store
1. Connect the external key store (will take a few minutes)
1. Select the newly created external key store
1. Select "Create a KMS key in this key store"
   a. Enter an external key ID corresponding to a PKCS#11 label that is allowed in the settings TOML. In the example above, this is "abc123".
   a. Enter an alias for this key.
   a. Set up the key administrators and key usage permissions.
1. You should now be able to use this Vault-backed key with the KMS API, e.g., `aws kms encrypt`.
