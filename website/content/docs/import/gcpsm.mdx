# GCP import source


Use the GCP source to import secret data from the GCP secret manager into your Vault instance. To use a GCP  source, you must grant GCP the following permissions:

```shell-session
"secretmanager.secrets.list",
"secretmanager.versions.access",
```

## GCP source parameters

* `name` - (Required) The name of the source block used to internally reference this source inside of a mapping.

* `credentials` - (Optional) The path to the service account key credentials file for the service account with the ncessary
permissions. If `credentials` is set, then `vault_mount_path` and `vault_role_name` must be unset.

* `vault_mount_path` - (Optional) The Vault mount path to a preconfigured GCP secrets engine that is used to generate a
dynamic credential for the importer to use. If `vault_mount_path` or `vault_role_name` are set, then `credentials` must be unset.

* `vault_role_name` - (Optional) The Vault role's name that exists in the preconfigured GCP secrets engine mount that is
used to generate a dynamic credential for the importer to use. If `vault_role_name` or `vault_mount_path` are set, then
`credentials` must be unset.

## Example

Define and configure the `my-gcp-source-1` GCP source:

```hcl
source_gcp {
  name = "my-gcp-source-1"
  secrets_engine_mount = "gcp"
  secrets_engine_role = "my-gcp-role-1"
}
```
