# GCP import source


Use the GCP source to import secret data from the GCP Secret Manager into your Vault instance. To use dynamic
credentials for this source, ensure that the [GCP secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/gcp) has
already been configured.

## GCP source parameters

- `name` - (Required) The unique name used by Vault to reference the GCP source elsewhere (e.g., in a mapping).

- `credentials` - (Optional) The path to the service account key credentials file for the service account with
  the necessary permissions. If `credentials` is set, then `vault_mount_path` and `vault_role_name` must be unset.

- `vault_mount_path` - (Optional) The Vault mount path to a pre-configured GCP
  secrets engine used to generate dynamic credentials for the importer. If
  `vault_mount_path` or `vault_role_name` are set, then `credentials` must be
  unset.

- `vault_role_name` - (Optional) The Vault role used to generate a dynamic
  credential for the importer. The role name must exist in the pre-configured
  GCP secrets engine mount. If `vault_role_name` or `vault_mount_path` are set,
  then `credentials` must be unset.

## Example

Define and configure the `my-gcp-source-1` GCP source:

```hcl
source_gcp {
  name                 = "my-gcp-source-1"
  secrets_engine_mount = "gcp"
  secrets_engine_role  = "my-gcp-role-1"
}
```

## Permissions

To use a GCP source, you must grant the GCP identity being used to read secrets the following permissions:

```shell-session
"secretmanager.secrets.list",
"secretmanager.versions.access",
```
