# Secrets import

<EnterpriseAlert product="vault" />

@include 'alerts/beta.mdx'

Distributing sensitive information across multiple external systems creates
several challenges, including:

- increased operational overhead.
- increased exposure risk from data sprawl.
- increased risk of outdated and out-of-sync information.

Using Vault as a single source of truth (SSOT) for sensitive data increases
security and reduces management overhead, but migrating data from multiple and
varied sources can be complex and costly. 

The secrets import process helps you automate and streamline your data
migration with codified import plans as HCL files. Import plans tell Vault
which data to read from a given source and where to store the data in the KVv2
secrets engine:

- the `source` block provides credentials for connecting to the source system.
- the `destination` block defines target mounts in KVv2.
- the `mapping` block define how Vault should transform the imported data before
  writing the information to KVv2.

## Data migration destinations

Vault stores imported secrets in a Vault KVv2 secrets engine mount. Destination
blocks start with `destination_vault` and define the desired KVv2 mount path and
an optional namespace. The combination of a path and namespace represent the exact location in your
Vault instance you want the information stored.

### HCL syntax


```hcl
destination_vault {
  name      = "my-dest-1"
  namespace = "ns-1"
  mount     = "mount-1"
}
```

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Vault destination block used to internally reference this destination inside of a mapping.

* `address` - (Optional) The address of the Vault server with the KVv2 Secrets Engine for which the secrets will be imported into.

* `token` - (Optional) A token for authentication to the Vault server located at the specified address.

* `namespace` - (Optional) The name of the Vault namespace containing the specified KVv2 mount.

* `mount` - (Optional) The name of the KVv2 mount in Vault for which the secrets will be imported into.



## Data migration sources

Secrets can be imported from various external systems, called sources. The supported destinations are:
* [GCP Secret Manager](/vault/docs/import/gcpsm)

A source requires the credentials necessary to read the external system's secrets and their values so that it may import
them into Vault. Either credentials to the system can be directly provided, or you can leverage Vault's capabilities to
geneerate a dynamic secret for the importer to use if you have the corresponding secrets engine configured. A source is
defined by an HCL block in the format of `source_<external_system>`. For example, `source_gcp` defines a source block
for GCP Secret Manager.

### HCL syntax

Refer to a [specific source's documentation](#sources) for details on how to define all remaining arguments of a source
block for that external system type.

#### Example

A `source_<external_system>` block may look like the following, using GCP as an example:

```hcl
source_gcp {
  name = "my-gcp-source-1"
  credentials = "@/path/to/service-account-key.json"
}
```

## Mappings

Mappings blocks are what glue together a source block to a destination block. The supported mapping types are:
* [mapping_passthrough](/vault/docs/import/mappings#passthrough)
* [mapping_metadata](/vault/docs/import/mappings#metadata)
* [mapping_regex](/vault/docs/import/mappings#regex)

A mapping is where filtering logic is defined to control which secrets in the external system will be imported and which will
be ignored. The definition of the rule depends on the type of mapping block that is being configured. Mapping blocks are
applied in order of their given priority.

Once a secret being imported matches a single mapping's rule, it cannot match to another mapping again. A mapping is defined
by an HCL block in the format of `mapping_<filter_type>`. For example, `mapping_regex` defines a mapping block to pass
all secrets through whose secret name passes the given regular expression.

### HCL syntax

See the [mapping documentation](/vault/docs/import/mappings) to see more info regarding specific mapping types and
their arguments.

#### Example

A `mapping_<filter_type>` block may look like the following, using regex as an example:

```hcl
mapping_regex {
  name = "my-map-1"
  source = "my-gcp-source-1"
  destination = "my-dest-1"
  priority = 1
  expression = "^database/.*$"
}
```
