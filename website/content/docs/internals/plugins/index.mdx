# Plugin System

All Vault auth and secret backends are considered plugins. This simple concept
allows both built-in and external plugins to be treated like Legos. Any plugin
can exist at multiple different locations. Different versions of a plugin may
be at each one, with each version differing from Vault's version.

## Built-In Plugins

Built-in plugins are shipped with Vault, often for commonly used implementations,
and require no additional operator intervention to run. Built-in plugins are
just like any other backend code inside Vault.

To use a different or edited version of a built-in plugin, the plugin must be
run as an external plugin.

## External Plugins

External plugins are not shipped with Vault. External plugins require
additional operator intervention to run.

To use a different or edited version of a built-in plugin or a plugin that is
not shipped with vault, the plugin must be run as an external plugin. To do
this, first edit the plugin's code or navigate to the Vault version holding the
desired plugin version. Next, `cd` into the `cmd/:plugin-name` directory
contained alongside that plugin's code. For example, for AppRole `cd` into the
`vault/builtin/credential/approle/cmd/approle` directory. Once in that
directory, run `go build` to obtain a new binary for the AppRole plugin.
Finally,
[register](/docs/internals/plugins/plugin-architecture#plugin-registration) the
plugin, and enable it.
