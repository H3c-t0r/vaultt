# Plugin System

All Vault auth and secret backends are considered plugins. This simple concept
allows both built-in and external plugins to be treated like Legos. Any plugin
can exist at multiple different locations. Different versions of a plugin may
be at each one, with each version differing from Vault's version.

## Built-In Plugins

Built-in plugins are shipped with Vault, often for commonly used implementations,
and require no additional operator intervention to run. Built-in plugins are
just like any other backend code inside Vault.

To use a different or edited version of a built-in plugin, you would first edit
the plugin's code or navigate to the Vault version holding the version of the
plugin you desire. Then, you'd `$ cd` into the `cmd/:plugin-name` directory
contained alongside that plugin's code. For instance, for AppRole, you would:
`$ cd vault/builtin/credential/approle/cmd/approle`. Once in that directory,
you would run `$ go build` to obtain a new binary for the AppRole plugin. Then
you would add it to the plugin catalog as per normal, and enable it.
