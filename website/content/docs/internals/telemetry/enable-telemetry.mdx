# Enable Vault telemetry gathering

Collect telemetry data from your Vault installation.

## Before you start

- **You must have Vault 1.14 or later installed and running**.
- **You must have access to your [Vault configuration](/vault/docs/configuration) file**.


## Step 1: Choose an aggregation agent

@include 'telemetry/supported-aggregation-agents.mdx'

## Step 2: Enable at least one audit device

To include audit-related metrics, you must enable auditing on at least one device
with the `vault audit enable` command. For example, to enable auditing for the
`file` device and save the logs to `/var/log/vault_audit.log`:

```shell-session
$ vault audit enable file file_path=/var/log/vault_audit.log
```

By default, Vault replicates audit device configuration to all nodes within a
cluster. Enterprise installations also replicate audit device configuration to
the primary node and all secondaries in a cluster. To disable replication, use
the `local` parameter:

```shell-session
$ vault audit enable file -local file_path=/var/log/vault_audit.log
```


## Step 3: Configure telemetry collection

To configure telemetry collection, update the telemetry stanza in your Vault
configuration with your collection preferences and aggregation agent details.

For example, the following `telemetry` stanza configures Vault with the standard
telemetry defaults and connects it to a Statsite agent running on the default
port within a company intranet at `mycompany.statsite`:

```hcl
telemetry {
  usage_gauge_period = "10m"
  maximum_gauge_cardinality = 500
  disable_hostname = false
  enable_hostname_label = false
  lease_metrics_epsilon = "1h"
  num_lease_metrics_buckets = 168
  add_lease_metrics_namespace_labels = false
  filter_default = true
  prefix_filter = ["+vault.token", "-vault.expire", "+vault.expire.num_leases"]
  statsite_address = "mycompany.statsite:8125"
}
```

## Step 4: Choose a reporting solution

You need to save or forward your telemetry data to a separate storage solution
for reporting, analysis, and alerting. Which solution you need depends on the
feature set provided by your aggregation agent and the protocol support of your
reporting platform.
