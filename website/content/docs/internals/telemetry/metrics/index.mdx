# Vault telemetry metrics reference 

The following sections describe the available Vault metrics. The metrics interval are approximately 10 seconds when manually triggering metrics output using the above-described signals. Some high-cardinality gauges, like `vault.kv.secret.count`, are emitted every 10 minutes, or at an interval configured in the `telemetry` stanza.

Some Vault metrics come with additional [labels](#metric-labels) describing the measurement in more detail, such as the namespace in which an operation takes place or the auth method used to create a token. This additional information is incorporated into the metrics name in the in-memory telemetry or other telemetry engines that do not support labels. The metric name in the table below is followed by a list of labels supported, in the order in which they appear, if flattened.

## Metric labels

| Metric                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Example                 |

| `cluster`              | The cluster name from which the metric originated; set in the configuration file, or automatically generated when a cluster is create                                                                                                                 | `vault-cluster-d54ad07` |
| `creation_ttl`         | Time-to-live value assigned to a token or lease at creation. This value is rounded up to the next-highest bucket; the available buckets are `1m`, `10m`, `20m`, `1h`, `2h`, `1d`, `2d`, `7d`, and `30d`. Any longer TTL is assigned the value `+Inf`. | `7d`                    |
