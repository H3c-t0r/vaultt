### MFA Enhancements

In the previous release, we introduced Login MFA support for Vault OSS customers.

We also provided an enhanced TOTP configuration experience via the QR code scan.

### Vault Agent: Support for using an existing valid certificate upon re-authentication

Enhancements have been made to the Vault agent to support parsing of a certificate that's been fetched. A new certificate will only be fetched upon a re-authentication, if the lifetime of the certificate has expired. This enhancement greatly reduces the resource overhead that Vault agent users often experience due to over-fetching of certificates.

- Tokenization search and convergent
- Tokenization key auto rotation
