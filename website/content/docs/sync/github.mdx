# GitHub

The GitHub repository sync destination allows Vault to safely synchronize secrets as GitHub repository action secrets.
This is a low footprint option that enables your applications to benefit from Vault-managed secrets without requiring them
to connect directly with Vault. This guide walks you through the configuration process.

Prerequisites:

* Ability to read or create KVv2 secrets
* Ability to create GitHub fine-grained or personal tokens with access to modify repository secrets
* Ability to create sync destinations and associations on your Vault server

## Setup

1. To get started with syncing Vault secrets to your GitHub repository, you'll need an access token.
  Please view the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
  to generate an access token. When creating your token, provide it access to the repository you want to manage secrets for,
  and allow "Read and Write" access to the repository secrets.

1. Configure the sync destination:

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write sys/sync/destinations/gh/my-gh-1 \
      access_token="$ACCESS_TOKEN" \
      repository_owner="$REPOSITORY_OWNER" \
      repository_name="$REPOSITORY_NAME"
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>
  
  ```text
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  connection_details    map[access_token:***** app_config:map[] repository_name:<repo name> repository_owner:<repo owner>]
  name                  my-gh-1
  type                  gh
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

## Usage

1. If you do not already have a KVv2 secret to sync, mount a new KVv2 secrets engine:

	```shell-session
	$ vault secrets enable -path='my-kv' kv-v2
	```

	**Output:**

	<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

	```text
	Success! Enabled the kv-v2 secrets engine at: my-kv/
	```
	
	</CodeBlockConfig>

1. Create secrets you wish to sync with a target GitHub repository:

	```shell-session
	$ vault kv put -mount='my-kv' my-secret foo=bar
	```

	**Output:**

	<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

	```text
  ==== Secret Path ====
  my-kv/data/my-secret
  
  ======= Metadata =======
  Key                Value
  ---                -----
  created_time       2023-09-19T13:17:23.395109Z
  custom_metadata    <nil>
  deletion_time      n/a
  destroyed          false
  version            1
	```
	
	</CodeBlockConfig>

1. Create an association between the destination and a secret to synchronize:

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write sys/sync/destinations/gh/my-gh-1/associations/set \
      mount='secret' \
      secret_name='foo'
      mount='secret' \
      secret_name='foo'
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>
  
  ```text
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  associated_secrets    map[kv_7532a8b4/foo:map[accessor:kv_7532a8b4 secret_name:foo sync_status:SYNCED updated_at:2023-09-22T14:45:28.031262-07:00]]
  store_name            my-gh-1
  store_type            gh
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository settings to confirm your secret was successfully created.

Moving forward, any modification on the Vault secret will be propagated in near real time to its GitHub repository secrets
counterpart. Creating a new secret version in Vault will create a new version in GitHub. Deleting the secret
or the association in Vault will delete the secret in GitHub as well.

<Note>

GitHub only supports single value secrets, so KVv2 secrets from Vault will be stored as a JSON string.
In the example above, the value for secret "foo" will be synced to GitHub as the JSON string `{"mypass":"bar"}`.
To extract out individual properties in a GitHub action workflow, consider using `jq`.

When synced to GitHub:
* Secret names with unsupported characters will be replaced by an "_".
* Secret names are capitalized, and case-insensitive.

</Note>
