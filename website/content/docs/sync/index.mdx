# Secrets Sync

Secrets sync enables users to manage their secrets with Vault while syncing a subset of them into
external secret store destinations. Secrets that will be synced must be individually associated
with each desired destination. This means that associating a secret named `my-secret` with a
destinated named `my-aws` will not automatically sync to second destination named `my-gcp`.

<Note>

Unsyncing a secret either by deleting the secret from Vault or from deleting its association
is a hard-delete option. This means it is immediately removed from the external system and bypasses
any soft-deletion states or recovery mechanisms.

</Note>

## Destinations

Secrets can be synced into various external stores, called destinations. Destinations are configured
separately for each type of external system. The supported destinations are listed:
* [AWS Secrets Manager](/vault/docs/sync/awssm)
* [Azure Key Vault](/vault/docs/sync/azurekv)
* [GCP Secret Manager](/vault/docs/sync/gcpsm)
* [GitHub Repository Actions](/vault/docs/sync/github)
* [Vercel Projects](/vault/docs/sync/vercelproject)

## Assocations

Choosing the secrets you want synced to a given destination is done by creating links between them,
called associations. Once a destination has been successfully configured, you can begin making the
associations to it by providing the secret's name and its mount. Each secret's association keeps
track of its current sync status, the timestamp of its last status change, and the error code of
the last sync or unsync operation, if it failed.


## Sync Statuses

There are several sync statuses which relay information about the outcome of the last sync
operation to have occurred on that secret. The status information is stored inside each
association object returned by the endpoint and, upon failure, includes an error code explaining why.

* `SYNCING` - The sync operation for the secret is currently in-progress.
* `SYNCED` - The sync operation was successful and sent the secret to the external destination.
* `UNSYNCING` - The unsync operation for the secret is currently in-progress.
* `UNSYNCED` - The unsync operation was successful and removed the secret from the external destination.
	This is returned when a secret itself is deleted but the association is not.
* `INTERNAL_VAULT_ERROR` - The sync or unsync operation failed due to an issue internal to Vault.
* `CLIENT_SIDE_ERROR` - The sync or unsync operation failed due to a configuration error.
	For example, the credentials used to configure the destination expired or were revoked.
* `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR` - The sync or unsync operation failed due to an issue with the
	external service provider's side.
* `UNKNOWN` - Vault is unable to determine the current state of the secret in regards to the external service.
