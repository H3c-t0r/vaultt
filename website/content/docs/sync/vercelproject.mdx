# Vercel Project environment variables

The Vercel Project sync destination allows Vault to safely synchronize secrets as Vercel environment variables.
This is a low footprint option that enables your applications to benefit from Vault-managed secrets without requiring them
to connect directly with Vault. This guide walks you through the configuration process.

Prerequisites:
* Ability to read or create KVv2 secrets
* Ability to create Vercel tokens with access to modify project environment variables
* Ability to create sync destinations and associations on your Vault server

## Setup

1. If you do not already have a Vercel token, navigate [your account settings](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) to
   generate credentials with the necessary permissions to manage your project's environment variables.

1. Next you need to locate your project ID. It can be found under the `Settings` tab in your project's overview page.

1. Configure a sync destination with the access token & project ID obtained in the previous steps.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write sys/sync/destinations/vercel-project/my-dest \
      access_token=<token> \
      project_id=<project-id> \
      deployment_environments=development \
      deployment_environments=preview \
      deployment_environments=production
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```plaintext
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  connection_details    map[access_token:***** deployment_environments:[development preview production] project_id:<project-id>]
  name                  my-dest
  type                  vercel-project
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

## Usage

1. If you do not already have a KVv2 secret to sync, mount a new KVv2 secrets engine.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault secrets enable -path=my-kv kv-v2
  Success! Enabled the kv-v2 secrets engine at: my-kv/
  ```

1. Store any KV secret into Vault.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault kv put -mount=my-kv my-secret foo=bar
  ==== Secret Path ====
  my-kv/data/my-secret

  ======= Metadata =======
  Key                Value
  ---                -----
  created_time       <timestamp>
  custom_metadata    <nil>
  deletion_time      n/a
  destroyed          false
  version            1
  ```

1. Create an association between your Vercel Project destination and the secret to synchronize.

  ```shell-session
  $ vault write sys/sync/destinations/vercel-project/my-dest/associations/set \
      mount=my-kv \
      secret_name=my-secret
  ```

  **Output:**

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```plaintext
  Key                   Value
  ---                   -----
  associated_secrets    map[kv_1234/my-secret:map[accessor:kv_1234 secret_name:my-secret sync_status:SYNCED updated_at:<timestamp>>]]
  store_name            my-dest
  store_type            vercel-project
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Navigate to your project's settings under the `Environment Variables` section to confirm your secret was successfully
  created in your Vercel project.

Moving forward, any modification on the Vault secret will be propagated in near real time to its Vercel environment variable
counterpart. Creating a new secret version in Vault will overwrite the value in your Vercel Project. Deleting the secret
or the association in Vault will delete the secret on Vercel as well.

Note that Vault KVv2 secrets are multi-values while Vercel environment variables are single value. As such the secret values
from Vault are exported as a json string.
