# Manage custom messages in the Vault UI

Use custom banners and modals in the Vault UI to share system-wide alerts for all Vault UI users.

<Tip title="Best practices for UI messages">

1. **Messages are sticky**. Users can only dismiss messages **temporarily**.
   The message reappears if the user refreshes their browser window or logs out
   of the current session.

1. **Messages are intrusive**. Limit the number of active messages to minimize
   the intrusion on users and reduce the chances that they will dismiss the
   message without reading it.

1. **Messages are inheritable**. Child namespaces inherit all messages created
   on the parent namespace. Take advantage of inheritance to reach the greatest
   number of users with the smallest number of messages.

1. **Delete old messages**. Vault supports a maximum of 100 messages per namespace at a
   time. Practice good message hygiene by regularly deleting expired and outdated
   messages.

</Tip>

## Before you start

- **You must have Vault 1.16.0 or higher installed**.
- **You must have permission to call the `sys/config/ui/custom-message` endpoint**:
  - To **create or edit messages** you must have `read`, `list`, and `create`
    permissions.
  
   ```hcl
   path "sys/config/ui/custom-message" {
      capabilities = [ "read", "list", "create" ]
   }
   ```

  - To **delete messages** you must have `list` and `delete` permissions.

   ```hcl
   path "sys/config/ui/custom-message" {
      capabilities = [ "list", "delete" ]
   }
   ```



## Add a custom message

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section in the Vault UI sidebar and select "Custom
   Messages".

1. On the **Custom messages** page, select whether you want the message
   to appear on the Vault UI login page or after a user logs in.

1. Select the **+ Create message** button in the toolbar to open the **Create message** form.

1. On the **Create message** form:

   - Select the locations where your message should appear.
   - Select the message type.
   - Provide a title and the message text. For important messages, we recommend
     keeping the text short and including a link to more information rather
     than writing a longer message that users may not take the time to read.
   - Set a start time when your message will publish. By default, messages
     publish at midnight in your local timezone.
   - Set an optional end time for the message. By default, messages do not
     expire.

1. Click **Preview** to see how your message will appear to users.

1. Click **Create message** to save your new message.
