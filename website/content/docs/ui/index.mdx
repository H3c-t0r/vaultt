# Vault UI

Vault features a web-based user interface (UI) that enables you to unseal,
authenticate, manage policies and secrets engines.

## Server configuration

To activate the UI, define the [`ui` stanza](/vault/docs/configuration/ui)
option in the Vault server configuration. The UI runs on the same port as the
Vault listener. As such, you must configure at least one `listener` stanza in
order to access the UI.

**Example:**

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```hcl
ui = true

listener "tcp" {
  address = "10.0.1.35:8200"

  # If bound to localhost, the Vault UI is only
  # accessible from the local machine!
  # address = "127.0.0.1:8200"
}
# ...
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

In this case, the UI is accessible at the following URL from any machine on the
subnet (provided no network firewalls are in place): `https://10.0.1.35:8200/ui`

It is also accessible at any DNS entry that resolves to that IP address, such as
the Consul service address (if using Consul):
`https://vault.service.consul:8200/ui`

<Note>

When you start the Vault server in dev mode, Vault UI is automatically enabled
and ready to use.
