# Upgrading Vault Plugins

The following procedure details steps for upgrading an external plugin that has
already been registered to the catalog on a running server. This procedure is
applicable to secret engines, auth methods, and database plugins.

## Upgrade Procedure

Vault executes plugin binaries when they are configured and roles are established
around them. The binary cannot be modified or replaced while running, so
upgrades cannot be performed by simply swapping the binary and updating the hash
in the plugin catalog.

Instead, you can restart or reload a plugin with the
`sys/plugins/reload/backend` [API][plugin_reload_api]. Follow these steps to
replace or upgrade a Vault plugin binary:

1. [Register][plugin_registration] version 1 of `my-db-plugin` to the catalog

```shell-session
$ vault plugin register -sha256=<SHA256 Hex value of the plugin binary> \
    database \                  # type
    my-db-plugin
```

2. [Mount][plugin_management] the plugin backend

```shell-session
$ vault secrets enable database
```

3. Register version 2 of `my-db-plugin` to the catalog under the same plugin
   name, but with updated command to run version 2 of `my-db-plugin` and updated
   sha256 of the new binary

```shell-session
$ vault plugin register -sha256=<SHA256 Hex value of the plugin binary> \
    database \                  # type
    my-db-plugin
```

4. Trigger a [plugin reload][/docs/commands/plugin/reload] to reload all
   mounted backends using that plugin or a subset of the mounts using that plugin
   with either the `plugin` or `mounts` parameter respectively.

```shell-session
$ vault plugin reload -plugin my-db-plugin
```

Until step 4, the mount will still use version 1 of `my-db-plugin`, and when
the reload is triggered, Vault will kill `my-db-plugin`â€™s process and start the
new plugin process for `my-db-plugin` version 2.

-> **Important:** Plugin reload of a new plugin binary must be
performed on each Vault instance. Performing a plugin upgrade on a single
instance or through a load balancer can result in mismatched
plugin binaries within a cluster. On a replicated cluster this may be accomplished
by setting the 'scope' parameter of the reload to 'global'.
