Vault 1.14. **Please read carefully**.

## Consul service registration

As of version 1.15, `service_tags` supplied to Vault for the purpose of [Consul
service registration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration/service-registration/consul#service_tags)
will be **case-sensitive**. In previous versions of Vault tags were lower-cased which
led to issues, for example when users supplied custom Traefik rules which use case-sensitive
method names such as `Host()`.
