# Overview

The Vault 1.15.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.14. **Please read carefully**.

## Consul service registration

As of version 1.15, `service_tags` supplied to Vault for the purpose of [Consul
service registration](/vault/docs/configuration/service-registration/consul#service_tags)
will be **case-sensitive**.

In previous versions of Vault tags were converted to lowercase which led to issues,
for example when tags contained Traefik rules which use case-sensitive method names
such as `Host()`.

If you previously used Consul service registration tags ignoring case, or relied
on the lowercase tags created by Vault, then this change may cause unexpected behavior.

Please audit your Consul storage stanza to ensure that you either:

* Manually convert your `service_tags` to lowercase if required
* Ensure that any system that relies on the tags is aware of the new case-preserving behavior

## Rollback metrics

The metrics `vault.rollback.attempts.{MOUNTPOINT}` and `vault.route.rollback.{MOUNTPOINT}`
are no longer measured by default. They have been replaced by `vault.rollback.attempts`
and `vault.route.rollback` metrics, which **do not** contain the mount point in
the metric name.

If you would like to continue measuring `vault.rollback.attempts.{MOUNTPOINT}`
and `vault.route.rollback.{MOUNTPOINT}`, you can enable these metrics using the
[`add_mount_point_rollback_metrics`](/vault/docs/configuration/telemetry#add_mount_point_rollback_metrics)
configuration option in the telemetry stanza.
