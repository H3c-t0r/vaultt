# Overview

The Vault 1.17.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.16. **Please read carefully**.

## Important changes

### Allowed audit headers now have unremovable defaults

The [config auditing API endpoint](/vault/api-docs/system/config-auditing#create-update-audit-request-header)
tells Vault to log incoming request headers (when present) in the audit log.

Previously, Vault only logged headers that were explicitly configured for
logging. As of version 1.17, Vault automatically logs a predefined set of
[default headers](/vault/docs/audit#default-headers). By default, the header
values are not HMAC encrypted. You must explicitly configure the
[HMAC setting](/vault/api-docs/system/config-auditing#hmac) for each of the
default headers if required.

Refer to the
[audit request headers documentation](/vault/docs/audit#audit-request-headers)
for more information.
