# Overview

The Vault 1.17.x upgrade guide contains information on deprecations, important
or breaking changes, and remediation recommendations for anyone upgrading from
Vault 1.16. **Please read carefully**.

## Important changes

### Allowed audit headers now have unremovable defaults

Vault provides an [API endpoint](/vault/api-docs/system/config-auditing#create-update-audit-request-header)
for Operators to allow a given header, if present in an incoming request, to appear
in audit logs.

In previous versions of Vault no headers were added unless the Operator had explicitly
configured them.

As of Vault 1.17 a predefined set of [default headers](/vault/docs/audit#default-headers)
are now added automatically. By default, the value of these headers **are not** HMAC'd,
but Operators can manually configure the [HMAC setting](/vault/api-docs/system/config-auditing#hmac)
for each of the default headers if required.

Please read the [audit request headers documentation](/vault/docs/audit#audit-request-headers)
for more detailed information.
