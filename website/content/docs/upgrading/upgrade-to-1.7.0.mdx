# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.7.0 compared to 1.6. Please read it carefully.

## Barrier Key Auto-Rotation

If your Vault installation is at least a year old, the barrier key will be 
automatically rotated once, and then subsequently will be rotated per the 
settings in the new `sys/rotate/config` endpoint.  This is a precaution to 
ensure the number of encryptions performed by the barrier key is fewer than that 
rrecommended by 
[NIST SP 800-38D](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38d/final).

## Known Issues

Due to the known issue, Transform Secrets Engine users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.6.4 or 1.7.0.

### Autopilot

* Autopilot is not currently supported on DR Secondary clusters, or in
  Integrated Storage's HA-only mode.
* If the IP address in the raft peer list is different from the configured
  cluster address, autopilot may be unable to determine the leader node. If
  affected, you should disabled autopilot by setting the
  `VAULT_RAFT_AUTOPILOT_DIABLE` environment variable to 1.
