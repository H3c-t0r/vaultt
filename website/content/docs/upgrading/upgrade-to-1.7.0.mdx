## Known Issues

Due to the known issue, Transform Secrets Engine users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.6.4 or 1.7.0.

### Autopilot

* Autopilot is not currently supported on DR Secondary clusters, or in
  Integrated Storage's HA-only mode.
* If the IP address in the raft peer list is different from the configured
  cluster address, autopilot may be unable to determine the leader node. If
  affected, you should disabled autopilot by setting the
  `VAULT_RAFT_AUTOPILOT_DIABLE` environment variable to 1.
