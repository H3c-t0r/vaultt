# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.8.0 compared to 1.7. Please read it carefully.

## License Enhancements

Licenses and EULA enhancements have been introduced in the Vault 1.8 release.
These changes are important for Enterprise customer to review. They do not affect
OSS users. Please see the [License](docs/enterprise/license) documentation for more details.

## Deprecations

The following API endpoints have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

* `PUT sys/license` to store licenses in storage; it is recommended to use
   [License Autoloading](/docs/enterprise/license/autoloading) instead.

* `/gcp/token/:roleset` and `/gcp/key/:roleset` paths for generating secrets for rolesets
  in GCP Secrets. Use `/gcp/roleset/:roleset/token` and `/gcp/roleset/:roleset/key` instead.
