# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.8.0 compared to 1.7. Please read it carefully.

## License Enhancements

Licenses and EULA enhancements have been introduced in the Vault 1.8 release.
These changes are important for Enterprise customers to review. They do not affect
OSS users. Please see the [License](/docs/enterprise/license) documentation for more details.

## Deprecations

The following API endpoints have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

* `sys/license` to manage licenses in storage; it is recommended to use
   [License Autoloading](/docs/enterprise/license/autoloading) instead.

* `/gcp/token/:roleset` and `/gcp/key/:roleset` paths for generating secrets for rolesets
  in GCP Secrets. Use `/gcp/roleset/:roleset/token` and `/gcp/roleset/:roleset/key` instead.

## Go Version

Vault 1.8.0 is built with Go 1.16. Please review the [Go Release
Notes](https://golang.org/doc/go1.16) for full details. Of particular note:

- Go 1.16 has added support for darwin/arm64. Vault binaries for this platform are
  now available supporting the Apple M1 CPU.
  
## Alpine 3.14

Docker images for Vault 1.8.2 and higher are built with Alpine 3.14, due to a security issue in Alpine 3.13 (CVE-2021-36159).
Some users on older versions of Docker may run into issues with these images.
See the following for more details:

- https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Release_Notes_for_Alpine_3.14.0#faccessat2
- https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/08/26/its-time-to-upgrade-docker-engine/

## Known Issues

- Vault Enterprise binaries for `arm64` architectures will crash immediately when using production-ready storage backends.  This issue is addressed in Vault 1.8.1.
- AWS Auth using the [EC2 method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws#ec2-auth-method)
  fails with the error `failed to verify the signature`. This effects 1.8.0 and 1.8.1 and there
  is not a workaround. The issue will be fixed in a future Vault minor release.
- Configuration files in RedHat packages for Vault were not properly flagged as
  config files for `fpm`, causing user-edited files on disk to be replaced with
  the defaults when a new package was installed. This
  [issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/12275) affects RedHat
  packages for Vault 1.8.0 and the 1.8.1-0 package, and is fixed in 1.8.1-1 and up.
