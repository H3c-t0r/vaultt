# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.9.0 compared to 1.8. Please read it carefully.

## Identity Tokens

The Identity secrets engine has changed the procedure for creating Identity
token roles. When creating a role, the key parameter is required and the key
must exist. Previously, it was possible to create a role and assign it a named
key that did not yet exist despite the documentation stating otherwise.

All calls to [create or update a role](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/identity/tokens#create-or-update-a-role)
must be checked to ensure that roles are not being created or updated with
non-existent keys.

## SSH Role Parameter `allowed_extensions` Behavior Change

Prior versions of Vault allowed clients to specify any extension when requesting
SSH certificate [signing requests](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/ssh#sign-ssh-key)
if their role had an `allowed_extensions` set to `""` or was missing.

Now, Vault will reject a client request that specifies extensions if the role
parameter `allowed_extensions` is empty or missing from the role they are
associated with.

To re-enable the old behavior, update the roles with a value
of `"*"` to the `allowed_extensions` parameter allowing any/all extensions to be
specified by clients.

## HTTP Request Counter Deprecation

In Vault 1.9, the internal HTTP Request count
[API](https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/system/internal-counters#http-requests)
will be removed from the product. Calls to the endpoint will result in a 404
error with a message stating that `functionality on this path has been removed`.

Vault does not make backwards compatible guarantees on internal APIs (those
prefaced with `sys/internal`). They are subject to change and may disappear
without notice.
