## Duplicative Docker images ((#duplicative-docker-images))

| Announced | Expected end of support | Expected removal |
| :-------: | :---------------------: | :--------------: |
| v1.12     | v1.13                   | v1.14

Previously, HashiCorp published and updated separate, identical Docker images of
Vault as a Verified Publisher image and Official image. As of v1.12, Vault no
longer supports the `vault` Docker image and will remove all
[duplicative Vault Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/vault). To continue
receiving updates, you will need to use the
[Verified Publisher](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/publish/)
[`hashicorp/vault`](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/vault)  image on
DockerHub.

<Highlight title="Include the version when pulling images">

  Use `docker pull hashicorp/vault:<version>` instead of
  `docker pull vault:version` to get newer versions of Vault in Docker images.
