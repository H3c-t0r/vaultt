For enterprise customers, HashiCorp provides official support for Consul and Vault's Integrated Storage as storage backends. Version 1.12.0 of Vault Enterprise will
not startup if configured to use a storage backend other than Consul or Integrated Storage. This was meant to protect against issues caused by using unsupported
backends that do not support transactional storage. Version 1.12.2 modified this behavior to instead log a warning to ensure that Vault will still start.
