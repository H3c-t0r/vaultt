### Internal error when vault policy in namespace does not exist
If a user is a member of a group that gets a policy from a 
namespace other than the one they’re trying to log into, 
and that policy doesn’t exist, we return an internal error. 
This impacts all auth methods.

#### Affected versions
This issue affects Vault Enterprise versions 1.14.x and higher.  A
fix will be released in Vault 1.15.2, 1.14.6, and 1.13.10.
