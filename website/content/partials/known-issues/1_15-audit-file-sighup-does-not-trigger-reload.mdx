### File audit devices do not honor SIGHUP signal to reload

#### Affected versions

- 1.15.0

#### Issue

Sending [`SIGHUP`](/vault/docs/audit/file#log-file-rotation) to Vault after rotating
an audit log file doesn't reopen the file path as expected.

If the file was moved (renamed), then Vault will continue to write data to the location
of the moved file.

If the file was deleted, then Vault will continue to write data to the deleted file.
The file will be deleted by the OS once Vault is sealed or restarted, but
until then will continue to consume disk space due to audit entries being written.

The issue has been fixed for a patch release in Vault `1.15.1`.

#### Workaround

If audit log rotation is a requirement for your Vault deployment, you can use the
following environment variable set to `true` in order to disable the new underlying
event framework Vault uses to process audit events.

| Environment variable name         | Value  |
|-----------------------------------|--------|
| `VAULT_AUDIT_DISABLE_EVENTLOGGER` | `true` |

Please note that this environment variable will be removed in a future release of Vault.
