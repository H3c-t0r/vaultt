### File audit devices do not honor SIGHUP signal to reload

#### Affected versions

- 1.15.0

#### Issue

Sending [`SIGHUP`](/vault/docs/audit/file#log-file-rotation) to Vault after rotating
an audit log file doesn't reopen the file path as expected.

If the file was moved (renamed), then Vault will continue to write data to the location
of the moved file.

If the file was deleted, then Vault will continue to write data to the deleted file.
The file will be deleted by the OS once Vault is sealed or restarted, but
until then will continue to consume disk space due to audit entries being written.

<Warning title="Missing Audit Entries">
  If the file was deleted (rather than moved locally) then audit entries written
  by Vault will be lost.
</Warning>

The issue with file audit devices not honoring SIGHUP signals is fixed as a patch release in Vault `1.15.1`.

#### Workaround

If your Vault cluster uses any `file` audit devices, you can use the following
environment variable set to `true` in order to disable the new underlying event
framework Vault uses to process audit events.


<Note title="Temporary workaround">
  The `VAULT_AUDIT_DISABLE_EVENTLOGGER` environment variable
  is a temporary solution and will be removed in a future release of Vault.
