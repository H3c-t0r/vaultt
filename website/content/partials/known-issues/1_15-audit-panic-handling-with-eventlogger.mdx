### Audit fails to recover from panics when formatting audit entries

#### Affected versions

- 1.15.0 - 1.15.5

#### Issue

The new underlying event framework for auditing causes Vault to incorrectly
attempt to handle panics if they occur during the formatting of audit entries.

This will cause the Vault server to stop running.

The issue with audit devices not handling panics is fixed as a patch release in Vault `1.15.6`.

#### Workaround

Set the `VAULT_AUDIT_DISABLE_EVENTLOGGER` environment variable to `true` to
disable the new underlying event framework and restart Vault:

```shell-session
$ export VAULT_AUDIT_DISABLE_EVENTLOGGER=true
```

On startup, Vault reverts to the audit behavior used in `1.14.x`.
