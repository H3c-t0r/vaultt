### Default policy needs to be updated in order for the version to appear in the Vault UI

#### Affected versions

- 1.16.0

#### Issue

Since the version information in both the `sys/health` and `sys/seal-status` un-authenticated
endpoints can now be redacted with the use of the **redact_version** TCP listener parameter,
the Vault UI uses a new authenticated endpoint `sys/internal/ui/version` to obtain the Vault
server's version.

The following rule has been added to the **default** policy that is automatically generated on
new Vault server.

```
# Allow a token to look up the Vault version. This path is not subject to
# redaction like the unauthenticated endpoints that provide the Vault version.
path "sys/internal/ui/version" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

However, the **default** policy in existing Vault servers is not updated automatically. It
must be updated manually be an operator with sufficient privileges in order for the Vault
version to be displayed in the Vault UI. No other functionality in the Vault UI is affected
be this issue.

To update the **default** policy, use the following commands:
```shell-session
$ vault policy read default | cat - <<< '
# Allow a token to look up the Vault version. This path is not subject to
# redaction like the unauthenticated endpoints that provide the Vault version.
path "sys/internal/ui/version" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}
' > default-policy.hcl
$ vault policy write default ./default-policy.hcl
```

This change to the default policy will allow the Vault UI to successfully query
the Vault server version and display it to the users.
