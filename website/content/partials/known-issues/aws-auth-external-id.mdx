### AWS Auth Role configuration requires an external_id

#### Affected Versions

- 1.17.0 - 1.17.3

#### Issue

The Vault AWS Auth backend requires an external_id to be set during role configuration, or it will return a validation error.

#### Workaround

Configure the backend with an external_id set (if external ids are not being used, supplying any string longer than two
characters will work). Then, configure any desired roles. After this is done, the external id can be removed.
