### Potential DoS when using the `deny_unauthorized` proxy protocol behavior for a TCP listener

#### Affected versions

##### Community Edition (CE)

- 1.10.x - 1.15.x
- 1.17.1

##### Enterprise

- 1.10.x+ent - 1.15.11+ent
- 1.16.5+ent
- 1.17.1+ent

#### Issue

Vault TCP listeners configured with the `deny_unauthorized` [proxy_protocol_behavior](/vault/docs/configuration/listener/tcp#proxy_protocol_behavior)
which receive a request from an untrusted upstream connection will close, causing
Vault to no longer respond to requests via that listener.

This leaves the Vault API vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by requests
which are intentionally made by untrusted upstream connections, causing it to become
unavailable on that node.

This issue is addressed in Vault 1.15.12+ent, 1.16.6+ent, 1.17.2, 1.17.2+ent and later.

#### Workaround

Do not configure a [proxy_protocol_behavior](/vault/docs/configuration/listener/tcp#proxy_protocol_behavior)
with the `deny_unauthorized` value.
