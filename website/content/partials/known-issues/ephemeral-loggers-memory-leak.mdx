### Vault is storing references to ephemeral sub-loggers leading to a memory leak

In Vault versions predating 1.13.7, 1.14.3, and 1.15.0 Vault does not honor a
modified `log_level` configuration for certain subsystem loggers on SIGHUP.

This is known to affect the `resolver.watcher` and `replication.index.*`
subloggers.

This can be seen after modifying the `log_level` and issuing a reload (SIGHUP),
For example, after starting a server with `log_level: "trace"` and modifying it
to `log_level: "info"` the following lines appear after reload:

```
[TRACE] resolver.watcher: dr mode doesn't have failover support, returning
...
[DEBUG] replication.index.perf: saved checkpoint: num_dirty=5
[DEBUG] replication.index.local: saved checkpoint: num_dirty=0
[DEBUG] replication.index.periodic: starting WAL GC: from=2531280 to=2531280 last=2531536
```

A change was introduced to resolve this issue:
`core: All sub-loggers now reflect configured log level on reload. [GH-22038]`

As a result of this change Vault would unexpectedly store references to ephemeral sub-loggers which prevents them from
being cleaned up, leading to a memory leak. This impacts many areas of Vault, but primarily logins in Enterprise.
There is no workaround.

The change that introduced this leak will be reverted in the next release, restoring the previously known behavior of
sub-loggers not updating log levels on SIGHUP.

#### Affected versions

This issue affects Vault Community and Enterprise versions:

- 1.13.7+
- 1.14.3+
- 1.15.0+

This change will be reverted in Vault 1.13.10, 1.14.6, 1.15.2, with a fix to arrive in a future Vault version.
