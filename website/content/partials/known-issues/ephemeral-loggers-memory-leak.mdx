### Vault is storing references to ephemeral sub-loggers leading to a memory leak

#### Affected versions

This memory leak affects Vault Community and Enterprise versions:

- 1.13.7 - 1.13.9
- 1.14.3 - 1.14.5
- 1.15.0 - 1.15.1

This change that introduced this leak will be reverted in the next release

#### Issue
Vault is unexpectedly storing references to ephemeral sub-loggers which prevents them from being cleaned up, leading to
a memory leak. This impacts many areas of Vault, but primarily logins in Enterprise.

#### Workaround
There is no workaround.
