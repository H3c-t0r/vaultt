### Fatal error during expiration metrics gathering causing Vault crash

#### Affected versions

This issue affects Vault Community and Enterprise versions:
- 1.13.9
- 1.14.5
- 1.15.1

A fix will be issued in Vault 1.13.10, 1.14.6, and 1.15.2.

#### Issue

A recent change to Vault to improve state change speed (e.g. becoming active or standby) introduced a concurrency issue
which can lead to a concurrent iteration and write on a map, causing a fatal error and crashing Vault. This error occurs
when gathering lease and token metrics from the expiration manager.

There is no workaround.
