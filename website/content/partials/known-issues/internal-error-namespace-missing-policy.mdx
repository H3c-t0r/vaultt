### Internal error when vault policy in namespace does not exist
If a user is a member of a group that gets a policy from a 
namespace other than the one they’re trying to log into, 
and that policy doesn’t exist, Vault returns an internal error. 
This impacts all auth methods.

#### Affected versions
- 1.13.8 and 1.13.9
- 1.14.4 and 1.14.5
- 1.15.0 and 1.15.1

A fix will be released in Vault 1.15.2, 1.14.6, and 1.13.10.
