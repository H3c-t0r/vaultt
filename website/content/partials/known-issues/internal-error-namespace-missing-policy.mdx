### Internal error when vault policy in namespace does not exist
If a user is a member of a group that gets a policy from a 
namespace other than the one they’re trying to log into, 
and that policy doesn’t exist, Vault returns an internal error. 
This impacts all auth methods.

#### Affected versions
- 1.13.8 and 1.13.9
- 1.14.4 and 1.14.5
- 1.15.0 and 1.15.1

A fix will be released in Vault 1.15.2, 1.14.6, and 1.13.10.

### Workaround
During authentication, vault adds all policies that can be applied to an entity.
This includes policies in separate namespaces. If vault attempts to add a policy
from another namespace _and_ this policy does not exist, vault will return an
internal error. The way to resolve this issue is to either add the policy, or to
delete the policy.

Below is an example of a userpass auth method that is failing because of a
missing group policy from another namespace.

```
`# Failed login
$ vault login -method=userpass username=user1 password=123
Error authenticating: Error making API request.

# Login should succeed now
