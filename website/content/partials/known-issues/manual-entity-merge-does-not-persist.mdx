### Manual entity merges sent to a PR secondary cluster are not persisted to storage

#### Affected versions

- Vault Enterprise v0.7.0+

#### Issue
If a manual entity merge is sent to a PR secondary cluster, the change is not persisted to storage, 
and will be reflected only temporarily on the PR secondary's active node. 

#### Workaround
All manual entity merge requests should be sent to the primary cluster.
