### Performance Standbys revert to Standby mode on unseal

#### Affected versions

- 1.14.12
- 1.15.8
- 1.16.2

#### Issue

If you previously set a value for `retention_months` via the
[sys/internal/counters/config](/vault-api/sys/counters/config) endpoint,
upgrading to Vault versions 1.14.12, 1.15.8, and 1.16.2 will cause Performance
Standby nodes to attempt a storage write during unseal, resulting in a read-only
storage error:

```
[ERROR] core: performance standby post-unseal setup failed: error="cannot write to readonly storage"
```

Adding nodes with Vault versions 1.14.12, 1.15.8, or 1.16.2 to a cluster with an
older versioned leader will see any previously set `retention_months` value and
attempt to update it to the new minimum value of `48`. The storage write will
result in a read-only error.

Performance Standby nodes will revert to Standby after upgrading. You can verify
the status of your nodes by checking the
[/sys/health](/vault/api-docs/system/health) endpoint.

Deployments that rely on scaling across Performance Standbys will now forward
all requests to the active node, increasing the utilization of the active node.

<Note title="Post-upgrade cluster membership">
During the last step of a full upgrade, the old leader steps down, causing one
of the Standby nodes to become leader.
</Note>

A fix for the read-only storage error has been prioritized and escalated. The
fix will be in releases 1.14.13, 1.15.9 and 1.16.3.

<Warning title="Important">
If you have already upgraded to versions 1.14.12, 1.15.8, or 1.16.2, please
refer to the workaround section for options.
</Warning>

#### Workaround

Once the leader of the cluster has been updgraded to version 1.14.12, 1.15.8, or
1.16.2, the workaround is to update the `retention_months` value on the active
node via the [sys/counters/config](/vault/api-docs/sys/counters/config)
endpoint:

```shell
$ vault write sys/internal/counters/config retention_months=48
```

This entry will be replicated to all nodes in the cluster, allowing them to
immediately unseal as Performance Standbys.

After this point, adding new nodes to the cluster will not cause the read-only
error.
