### Collapsed navbar does not allow you to click inside the console or namespace picker

#### Affected versions

This issue affects Vault versions 1.14.0+ and 1.15.0+. A fix for this version will be released in Vault 1.16.0.

#### Issue

The version of HDS the UI is using does not allow users to click inside the dev console or namespace picker when accessing these components from the collapsed view, triggered in smaller viewports.

#### Workaround

Expand the width of the screen until the full navbar is displayed, and click the components from within this state.
