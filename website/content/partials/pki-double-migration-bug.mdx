### PKI storage migration revives deleted issuers

Vault 1.11 introduced Storage v1, a new storage layout that supported
multiple issuers within a single mount. Bug fixes in Vault 1.11.6, 1.12.2,
and 1.13.0, corrected a write-ordering issue that lead to invalid CA chains.
Specifically, incorrectly ordered writes would fail and trigger a mass mount
migration. Too many mounts attempting migration at the same time would result
in an incorrect CA chain. The collection of bug fixes introduced Storage v2.
#### Impacted Versions

Issuers created before Vault 1.11 and migrated to Storage v1 and deleted
before upgrading to a Vault version with Storage v2 were incorrectly
recreated during the upgrade when Vault automatically re-migrated legacy
issuers. Migration failed if Vault found managed keys associated with the
legacy issuers that had been removed from the managed key repository. The
error appeared in Vault logs as:

> Error during migration of PKI mount:
>   failed to lookup public key from managed key:
>     no managed key found with uuid

This has been fixed in Vault 1.14.0, 1.13.4, 1.12.8, and 1.11.12.
