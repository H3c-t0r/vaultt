### PKI storage migration revives deleted issuers

Vault 1.11 introduced Storage v1, a new storage layout that supported
multiple issuers within a single mount. Bug fixes in Vault 1.11.6, 1.12.2,
and 1.13.0 corrected a write-ordering issue that lead to invalid CA chains.
Specifically, incorrectly ordered writes could fail due to load, resulting
in the mount being re-migrated next time it was loaded or silently
truncating CA chains. This collection of bug fixes introduced Storage v2.

#### Impacted Versions

Issuers created before Vault 1.11, migrated to Storage v1, and deleted
before upgrading to a Vault version with Storage v2 were incorrectly
recreated during the upgrade when Vault automatically re-migrated legacy
issuers. Migration could fail if Vault found managed keys associated with the
legacy issuers that had been removed from the managed key repository. The
error appeared in Vault logs as:

> Error during migration of PKI mount:
>   failed to lookup public key from managed key:
>     no managed key found with uuid

Issuers created in Vault 1.11 and later are not impcated. Direct upgrades
to a Storage v2 layout are not affected.

This has been fixed in Vault 1.14.0, 1.13.4, 1.12.8, and 1.11.12.
