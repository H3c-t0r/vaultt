### PKI storage migration revives deleted issuers

In Vault 1.11, a new storage layout was created to support multiple issuer
within a single mount, creating storage version 1. In Vault 1.11.6, 1.12.2,
and 1.13.0, a bug was fixed wherein (due to incorrect ordering of writes),
the CA chain could be incorrect, due to writes failing when too many mounts
attempted migration at the same time; this introduced storage version 2.

#### Impacted Versions

If issuers were present pre-1.11, and were subsequently deleted prior to
upgrading to a Vault version with storage version 2, the initial migration
of issuers would be re-attempted and these issuers would be recreated. If
managed keys were associated with these legacy versions (and were
subsequently removed from the managed key repository), migration would fail
with an error in the logs:

> Error during migration of PKI mount:
>   failed to lookup public key from managed key:
>     no managed key found with uuid

This has been fixed in Vault 1.14.0, 1.13.4, 1.12.8, and 1.11.12.
