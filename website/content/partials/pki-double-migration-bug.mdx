### PKI storage migration revives deleted issuers

Vault 1.11 introduced Storage v1, a new storage layout that supported
multiple issuers within a single mount. Bug fixes in Vault 1.11.6, 1.12.2,
and 1.13.0, corrected a write-ordering issue that lead to invalid CA chains.
Specifically, incorrectly ordered writes would fail and trigger a mass mount
migration. Too many mounts attempting migration at the same time would result
in an incorrect CA chain. The collection of bug fixes introduced Storage v2.
#### Impacted Versions

If issuers were present pre-1.11, and were subsequently deleted prior to
upgrading to a Vault version with storage version 2, the initial migration
of issuers would be re-attempted and these issuers would be recreated. If
managed keys were associated with these legacy versions (and were
subsequently removed from the managed key repository), migration would fail
with an error in the logs:

> Error during migration of PKI mount:
>   failed to lookup public key from managed key:
>     no managed key found with uuid

This has been fixed in Vault 1.14.0, 1.13.4, 1.12.8, and 1.11.12.
