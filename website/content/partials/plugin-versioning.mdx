Plugins can optionally self-report their own semantic version. For plugins that
do so, Vault will automatically populate the plugin's version in the catalog
without requiring the user to provide it. If users do provide a version during
registration, Vault will validate the version provided matches what the plugin
reports. Plugins that report a non-empty version _must_ report a valid
[Semantic Version](https://semver.org/) with a leading 'v' added or registration
will fail, e.g. `v1.0.0` or `v2.3.2-beta`.

To leverage plugin versioning, plugins should first upgrade the Vault SDK
package to at least v0.6.0.
