Prior to Vault 1.15, rollback metrics are defined for each configured mount point.
Metric names convert forward slashes (`/`) in mount names to dashes (`-`). For
example, if you have the `auth/token` backend configured, the corresponding mount
point metric string is `auth-token`

Starting in Vault 1.15, rollback metrics default to not having the mount point
in their metric name or in their labels. Rollback metrics with the mount point
can be enabled by setting the [`add_mount_point_rollback_metrics`](/vault/docs/configuration/telemetry#add_mount_point_rollback_metrics)
configuration option in the telemetry stanza.
