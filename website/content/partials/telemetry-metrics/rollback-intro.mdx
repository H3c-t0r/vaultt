Prior to Vault 1.15, rollback metrics are defined for each configured mount point.
Metric names convert forward slashes (`/`) in mount names to dashes (`-`). For
example, if you have the `auth/token` backend configured, the corresponding mount
point metric string is `auth-token`

Starting in Vault 1.15, rollback metrics do not have the mount point in their
metric name or in their labels.
