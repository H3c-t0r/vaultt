Mount-specific route metrics for each configured mount point. Metric names
convert forward slashes (`/`) in mount names to dashes (`-`). For example, if
you have the `auth/token` backend configured, the corresponding mount point
metric string is `auth-token`

Starting in Vault 1.15, the rollback route metric defaults to not having the
mount point in its name or labels. The metric with the mount point can be
enabled by setting the [`add_mount_point_rollback_metrics`](/vault/docs/configuration/telemetry#add_mount_point_rollback_metrics)
configuration option in the telemetry stanza.
