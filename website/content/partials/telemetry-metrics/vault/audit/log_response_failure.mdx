| Metric type | Value  | Description                                                                               |

| counter     | number | The number of audit log response failures across all devices                              |

The number of response failures is a **crucial metric**.

When using Prometheus sink use `rate` or `irate` to convert this into the number of failures
over a specific time period.

When using Vault's built-in `/metrics` output format, counters are reported aggregated over 
the metrics interval which defaults to 10 seconds. The `count` is the total number of errors that occured 
during the interval while the `mean` is normalized to the per-second rate of errors during the interval. 

Any increase in this counter indicates that all the configured audit devices failed to log a request (or response). 
If Vault cannot properly audit a request, or the response to a request, the original request will fail.

Refer to the Vault logs and any device-specific metrics to troubleshoot the
failing audit log device.
