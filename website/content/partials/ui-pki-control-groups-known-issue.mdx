### Control groups on GET requests for PKI issuers does not resolve in UI

If a user is trying to access PKI issuer details from the UI and they have
a control group for reading them, they will be caught in a loop when trying to
access the issuer from the issuers list view.

As a workaround, users constrained by control groups can search for an issuer
from the overview page rather than through the issuers list tab.

#### Impacted Versions

Affects all current versions of 1.14.x
