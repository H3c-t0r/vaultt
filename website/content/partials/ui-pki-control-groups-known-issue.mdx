### Control Groups with Issuer detail reads only accessible in UI from overview

Given a scenario where a user can only read an Issuer's details after Control Group
approval, they will constantly be directed to the Control Group Access page when
attempting to link to the Issuer details page from the Issuer list page.

As a workaround, users constrained by Control Groups can select an Issuer to view
details for from the overview page rather than through the Issuers list page.

#### Impacted Versions

Affects all current versions of 1.14.x
