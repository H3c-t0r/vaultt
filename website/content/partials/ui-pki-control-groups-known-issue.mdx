### Users limited by control groups can only access issuer detail from PKI overview page

<Note title="Affected versions">

Vault 1.14.x

</Note>

Vault UI users who require control group approval to read issuer details are
directed to the Control Group Access page when they try to view issuer details
from links on the Issuer list page.

As a workaround, Vault UI users constrained by control groups should select
issuers from the **PKI overview** page to view detailed information instead of
the **Issuers list** page.
