# Resource Quotas

Every single interaction with Vault, whether to put secrets into the key/value
store or to generate new pairs of database credentials for the MySQL database,
needs to go through Vaultâ€™s API.

One side effect of the API driven model is that applications and users can
misbehave by overwhelming system resources through consistent and high volume API
requests resulting in DoS issues in some Vault nodes or even the entire Vault
cluster. This risk is significantly increased when Vault API endpoints are exposed
to thousands or millions of services deployed across a global infrastructure,
especially in use cases of Vault where Vault is deployed as a service for internal
developers.

Vault provides a feature, resource quotas, that allows Vault operators to specify
limits on resources used in Vault. Specifically, Vault allows operators to create
and configure API rate limits.

## Rate Limit Quotas

Vault allows operators to create rate limit quotas which enforce API rate
limiting using a [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) algorithm.
A rate limit quota can be created at the root level or defined on a namespace or
mount by specifying a `path` when creating the quota. The rate limiter is applied
to each unique client IP address on a per-node basis (i.e. rate limit quotas
are not replicated). A client may invoke `burst` requests at any given second,
after which they may invoke additional requests at `rate` per-second, where `burst`
must be greater than or equal to `rate`.

A rate limit quota defined at the root level, essentially to the entire Vault API,
is inherited to all mounts. However, a rate limit quota can be defined for a mount,
which will take precedence over inherited quotas.

Vault also allows the inspection of the state of rate limiting in a Vault node
through various [metrics](/docs/internals/telemetry#Resource-Quota-Metrics) exposed
and through enabling optional audit logging.

## API

Rate limit quotas can be managed over the HTTP API. Please see
[Rate Limit Quotas API](/api/system/rate-limit-quotas) for more details.
