# Resource Quotas

Every single interaction with Vault, whether to put secrets into the key/value
store or to generate new pairs of database credentials for the MySQL database,
needs to go through Vault’s API.

One side effect of the API driven model is that applications and users can
misbehave by overwhelming system resources through consistent and high volume API
requests resulting in DoS issues in some Vault nodes or even the entire Vault
cluster. This risk is significantly increased when Vault API endpoints are exposed
to thousands or millions of services deployed across a global infrastructure,
especially in use cases of Vault where Vault is deployed as a service for internal
developers. 

Vault provides a feature, resource quotas, that allows Vault operators to specify
limits on resources used in Vault. Specifically, Vault allows operators to create
and configure API rate limits.

<!-- Vault’s operators are generally not the end consumers of its data and have
limited to no control over how applications that use Vault are designed or
implemented.  -->
