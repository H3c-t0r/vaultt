# `tencentcloudkms` Seal

The TencentCloud KMS seal configures Vault to use TencentCloud KMS as the seal wrapping mechanism.
The TencentCloud KMS seal is activated by one of the following:

- The presence of a `seal "tencentcloudkms"` block in Vault's configuration file.
- The presence of the environment variable `VAULT_SEAL_TYPE` set to `tencentcloudkms`.
  If enabling via environment variable, all other required values specific to
  TencentCloud KMS (i.e. `TENCENTCLOUD_KMS_KEY_ID`) must be also supplied, as well as all
  other TencentCloud-related environment variables that lends to successful authentication.

## `tencentcloudkms` Example

This example shows configuring TencentCloud KMS seal through the Vault configuration file
by providing all the required values:

```hcl
seal "tencentcloudkms" {
  region     = "Your-KMS-region"
  access_key = "Your-SecretId"
  secret_key = "Your-SecretKey"
  kms_key_id = "Your-KMS-KeyId"
}
```

## `tencentcloudkms` Parameters

These parameters apply to the `seal` stanza in the Vault configuration file:

- `region` `(string: <required> "ap-guangzhou")`: The TencentCloud region where the encryption key
  lives. My also be specified by the `TENCENTCLOUD_REGION` environment variable.

- `access_key` `(string: <required>)`: The TencentCloud secret id to use. May also be specified by
  `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID` environment variable.

- `secret_key` `(string: <required>)`: The TencentCloud secret key to use. May also be specified by
  `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.

- `kms_key_id` `(string: <required>)`: The TencentCloud KMS key id to use for encryption and decryption.
  May also be specified by `TENCENTCLOUD_KMS_KEY_ID` environment variable.

## Authentication

Authentication-related values must be provided, either as environment variables or
as configuration parameters.

~> **Note:** Although the configuration file allows you to pass in
`TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID` and `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY` as part of the seal's parameters,
it is _strongly_ recommended to set these values as environment variables.

TencentCloud authentication values:

- `TENCENTCLOUD_REGION`
- `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID`
- `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY`

Note: The client uses the official TencentCloud SDK and will use environment credentials,
the specified credentials, or CAM role credentials in that order.

## `tencentcloudkms` Environment Variables

Alternatively, the TencentCloud KMS seal can be activated by providing the following environment variables:

Vault seal specific values:

- `VAULT_SEAL_TYPE`
- `TENCENTCLOUD_KMS_KEY_ID`
