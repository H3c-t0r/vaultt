# `sentinel` Stanza

The sentinel stanza specifies configurations for Vault's Sentinel integration.

```hcl
sentinel {
  additional_enabled_modules = ["http"]
}
```

## Requirements

A valid Vault Enterprise license is required for use of Sentinel policies.

## `sentinel` Parameters

The sentinel stanza currently supports only one parameter, `additional_enabled_modules`.

- `additional_enabled_modules` `(string array: [])`` - Specifies a list of
  sentinel policy modules to enable above the default set.  For example,
  adding "http" to this list indicates sentinel policies may import

  ~> **Warning**: Care should be taken when enabling some modules which
  could have performance and security implications in policies.  For
  example, enabling "http" could cause your Vault servers to submit outbound
  requests to arbitrary endpoints.  See [the Sentinel Documentation](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/imports/http/)
  for more information.
