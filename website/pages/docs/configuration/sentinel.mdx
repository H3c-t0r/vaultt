# `sentinel` Stanza

The sentinel stanza specifies configurations for 
[Vault's Sentinel](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/sentinel) integration.

```hcl
sentinel {
  additional_enabled_modules = ["http"]
}
```

## Requirements

A valid Vault Enterprise license is required for use of Sentinel policies.

## `sentinel` Parameters

The sentinel stanza currently supports only one parameter, `additional_enabled_modules`.

- `additional_enabled_modules` `(string array: [])`` - By default Vault supports
  all of Sentinel's [standard imports](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/imports/)
  except "http", which has performance and security implications.

  This parameter specifies a list of modules to allow.  At this time "http"
  is the only candidate, but in the future other Sentinel modules that may not
  be included could be overridden here.
  

  ~> **Warning**: Care should be taken when enabling modules which
  could have performance and security implications in policies.  Enabling "http" 
  could cause your Vault servers to submit outbound requests to arbitrary endpoints.  
  See the 
  [Sentinel HTTP Module ](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/imports/http/)
  documentation for more information.
