# Vault Enterprise Best Practices Cluster

Vault's enterprise features focus around replication. Typically, one cluster is a leader, and other
clusters are followers. There are two main types of following clusters. Disaster replication clusters
serve as a warm standby should the leader cluster stop serving traffic. Performance replication
clusters increase the number of reads that Vault can service.

AWS is given here in depth as a sample for auto-unseal, but any [auto-unseal](/docs/configuration/seal)
mechanism may be used.

## Walk-Through

1. Create an EKS cluster. This walk-through will assume it's named "vault-cluster".
2. While the cluster is launching, create a role for Vault's node group to use.
[AWS's docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/worker_node_IAM_role.html)
should be considered the authority on the policies that need to be attached, but at the time
of writing, the required policies are the `AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy`, the `AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy`,
and the `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`. For the purposes of this walk-through, we will
assume you name this new role, "EKSNodeGroupForAutoUnseal".
3. While the cluster is launching, also create a KMS key that will be used for auto-unseal.
Under "Define key usage permissions", search for "EKSNodeGroupForAutoUnseal" and add a check
next to it.
4. One you've finished creating the key, return to IAM. Create a new policy called
"UnsealKeyUsageForVault" and attach it to the "EKSNodeGroupForAutoUnseal" role. The policy
contents should be:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:Encrypt",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:012345678901:key/207a68f5-f100-410c-8066-EXAMPLE"
        }
    ]
}
```

5. Return to EKS and add a node group. While launching it, under "Node IAM Role Name", select
"EKSNodeGroupForAutoUnseal".
6. While the nodes are creating, point your local `kubectl` at your new cluster as shown
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html).

## Generate TLS Certificates

TLS certificate generation is covered [here](/docs/platform/k8s/helm/examples/standalone-tls).

## Setting Up the Primary Cluster

The below `values.yaml` can be used to set up a three server Vault cluster using
Consul as a highly available storage backend, with AWS KMS for Auto Unseal.

```yaml
server:
  image:
    repository: "hashicorp/vault-enterprise"
    tag: "1.3.1_ent"

  affinity: |
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: {{ template "vault.name" . }}
              release: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
              component: server
          topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname

  service:
    enabled: true

  ha:
    enabled: true
    replicas: 3

    config: |
      ui = true

      listener "tcp" {
        tls_cert_file = "/path/to/fullchain.pem"
        tls_key_file  = "/path/to/privkey.pem"
        tls_client_ca_file = "/vault/userconfig/vault-server-tls/vault.ca"
        address = "[::]:8200"
        cluster_address = "[::]:8201"
      }

      storage "consul" {
        path = "vault"
        address = "HOST_IP:8500"
        token = "45a3bd52-07c7-47a4-52fd-0745e0cfe967"
      }

      seal "awskms" {
        region     = "us-west-2"
        kms_key_id = "19ec80b0-dfdd-4d97-8164-c6examplekey"
      }
```

Note that in the above seal stanza, the AWS key and secret are omitted. That's because
Vault picks them up from the node group's Instance Metadata, which in this example has
been configured to provide credentials for the "EKSNodeGroupForAutoUnseal" role.

## Setting Up a Disaster Replication (DR) Cluster

Setting up a DR cluster follows an identical process and configuration for
creating the cluster itself. Once the cluster is up, add it as a follower to
the leader cluster. See [Disaster Recovery Replication Setup](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/operations/ops-disaster-recovery)
for more.

## Setting Up a Performance Cluster

Setting up a performance cluster also follows an identical process and configuration
for creating the cluster itself. See [Setting Up Performance Replication](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/operations/ops-replication)
for more on how to configure a cluster to follow the primary once it is up.
