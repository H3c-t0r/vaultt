# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.5.0 compared to 1.4.1. Please read it carefully.

## Raft Configuration

A new Raft configuration value, `max_entry_size`, has been introduced. This value
limits the size in bytes for a Raft K/V entry. It applies to both put operations and
transactions. Any put or transaction operation exceeding this configuration value
will cause the respective operation to fail. The default value for this
configuration is 1MiB.

In addition, a new metric has been introduced, `vault.raft-storage.entry_size`,
that allows for operators to sample the entry size, view the average, and adjust
the configuration value as necessary. For additional details, please see
[Raft configuration](docs/configuration/storage/raft).

## Known Issues

Enabling telemetry on 32-bit systems will cause Vault to crash.  A workaround for this
issue is to disable collection of usage gauges in the [telemetry](docs/configuration/telemetry) stanza of the configuration.

```
telemetry {
  ...
  usage_gauge_period = "none"
}
```

This will suppress the metrics `vault.identity.entity.count`, `vault.identity.entity.alias.count`, `vault.token.count`, `vault.token.count.by_auth`, `vault.token.count.by_policy`, `vault.token.count.by_ttl` and `vault.secret.kv.count` that were introduced in version 1.5.0, but all other Vault telemetry will remain available.
