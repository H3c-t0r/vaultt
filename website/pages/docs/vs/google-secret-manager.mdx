# Vault vs. Google Secret Manager

Google Secret Manager is a Google Cloud service that provides a secure and
convenient method for storing API keys, passwords, certificates, and other
sensitive data. Secret Manager provides a central place and single source of
truth to manage, access, and audit secrets across Google Cloud.

With Google Secret Manager, users must authenticate with Google Cloud
credentials in order to access secrets. With Vault, users can authenticate to
and retrieve secrets from Vault via many pluggable systems like
username/password, TLS certificates, or LDAP.

While both tools offer solutions for managing secrets, Vault is also an identity
broker and features the ability to dynamically generate secrets with expiration
times.

Vault is an open source tool that can be deployed to any environment or any
Cloud. Google Secret Manager is only available as a first-party solution on
Google Cloud.
