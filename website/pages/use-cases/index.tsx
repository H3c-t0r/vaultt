                This creates potentially thousands of consumers that need access
                to one or more databases. Safeguarding and ensuring that one of
                these credentials isn’t leaked, or in the likelihood it is, that
                the organization can quickly revoke access and remediate, is a
                complex problem to solve.

                  This allows each application, service, or user to dynamically
                  get unique credentials to access the database(s) as well as
                  lease and expiration times for the credentials. This means
                  that the credentials will expire and reduce impact of breached
                  from leaked credentials.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a scenario where credentials are lost or stolen, the window
                  for those credentials to be valid can be reduced to almost
                  nothing or instant-use only. If credentials are stolen or
                  leaked, the same automated workflow for issuance and rotation
                  can also automatically revoke access and seal Vault and lock
                  down from outside access.
