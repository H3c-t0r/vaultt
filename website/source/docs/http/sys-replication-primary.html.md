# /sys/replication/primary/enable

## POST

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    Enables replication in primary mode. This is used when replication is currently disabled on the cluster
	(if the cluster is already a secondary, it must be promoted).
  </dd>

  <dt>Method</dt>
  <dd>POST</dd>

  <dt>URL</dt>
  <dd>`/sys/repliation/primary/enable`</dd>

  <dt>Parameters</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="param">primary_cluster_addr /span>
        <span class="param-flags">optional</span>
       Can be used to override the cluster address that
	   the primary gives to secondary nodes. Useful if the 
	   primaryâ€™s cluster address is not directly accessible
	   and must be accessed via an alternate path/address.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>Returns</dt>
 <dd>`204` response code.
 </dd>
</dl>

# /sys/replication/primary/demote

## POST

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
    Demotes a primary cluster to a secondary. This secondary cluster 
	will not attempt to connect to a primary (see the update-primary call),
	but will maintain knowledge of its cluster ID and can be reconnected
	to the same replication set without wiping local storage.

# /sys/replication/primary/disable

## POST

<dl>
  <dt>Description</dt>
  <dd>
   Disable replication entirely on the cluster. Any secondaries will no longer be able to connect.
   Caution: re-enabling this node as a primary or secondary will change its cluster ID; in the secondary
   case this means a wipe of the underlying storage when connected to a primary, and in the primary case,
   secondaries connecting back to the cluster (even if they have connected before) will require a wipe of
   the underlying storage.
